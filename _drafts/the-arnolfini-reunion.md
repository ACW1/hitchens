One of the main reasons for creating this new website/blog is my annoyance at writing threads on Twitter. No doubt there's really handy way at doing it without wasting much time cramming everything into the limited available spaces. I don't know it. My way was to waste a lot of time building this 'venue' for the longer pieces that needs to get out of my brain into an indifferent world. Indifferent it will surely be, but that's okay. The urge to collect my thoughts on the subjects that will be dealt with here is stronger than the need for applause. I might have called called this place *Center for Intrinsically Motivated Texts*, for that matter. But I preferred *Tuur* (pronounced like the German *Tür* – or the Old Norse theonym *Týr*). Strange as it may sound to the English ear, Tuur is a hypocorism of my first name, Arthur. *Tuur* is also the first-person present-tense of the verb *turen* – 'to peer, stare, gaze, pry'. *Nomen est omen*, because that's what I do: I *tuur* at works of art.

My latest target has been *Reunion* by Andrea Kowch. I wasn't aware of its existence, or of the artist, until I came across this tweet from Journal of Art in Society: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s evening in the countryside ~ a young woman muses quietly as she sits modestly in the train, pet dog at her side. She holds a ribboned gift; maybe it’s for a meeting with the person in the car which we can see through the large window (Andrea Kowch, ‘Reunion’) <a href="https://t.co/Vur996v3ef">pic.twitter.com/Vur996v3ef</a></p>&mdash; Journal of Art in Society (@artinsociety) <a href="https://twitter.com/artinsociety/status/1561956706217000960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I thought this was a painting from the 1920s or '30s, until I found out that Kowch was born in 1986 and made it in 2018... 

Why was the painting set almost a century in the past? What is the woman thinking about? What about that gift? What about that car? This work raises many questions. And many answers as well. After joining the speculation party below the tweet, I felt the need to unpack my fragmentary and cramped little contributions into something more solid and roomy.

What made me think of Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434)? Perhaps it was the woman's pale complexion and her uncommon headdress. In my view that combination gives the head a late medieval look. Another duo points particularly to the Van Eyck painting: the dog, emblem of fidelity and love, and the 'mirror' straight above it.

I would have been less convinced of the double reference if the 'mirror' in the train hadn't been positioned straight above the dog. It's like a hand mirror attached to a wall, but since mirrors don't have switches, it is probably a – mirror-like – lamp. Since it doesn't appear to be switched on, the lamp is both an equivalent and an opposite of the Arnolfini mirror. That mirror is like an all-seeing eye, while the lamp is like an eye that is clouded over, as though it is suffering from a cataract. While the upturned switch stresses the lack of light, the 'teeth' of the 'cogwheel' around the mirror stress the surplus of light. First, because they suggest the stylized rays of a stylized sun. Second, because those 'teeth' are filled with images of the Passion of Jesus, a.k.a. Light of the World.

            caption="The mirror and its equivalent" %}

The gear-like shape of the mirror also reminds one of watches, and of God as the Divine Watchmaker. (Gears where already used in clocks in Van Eyck's time, so it's not impossible that the watchmaker analogy already formulated in the fifteenth century.) But, if God the Son is in the 'teeth' of the mirror and God the Father is all-seeing eye in the center, then where is God the Holy Ghost? Is it the red ring with the blue rectangles that connects the two? Other options lie outside the mirror: the pearly thing with the green tassels hanging on a nail to the left of the mirror. Or the chandelier above the mirror. Neither is a very convincing Holy Ghost. Simply because they're not one with the Father and Son in the mirror. And while a chandelier in itself might well be a symbol of the Holy Ghost, this particular one is less suitable because there's only one candle burning in it. 

Why is that? And why do I think that the chandelier shows a lack of light, while it's broad daylight and there's no need for candlelight at all? It's actually a surplus of light. The one burning candle may refer to the eternal flame of a santuary lamp in churches in synagogues. But as far as I know these hold only one burning candle and not several extinguished candles next to it. Some think that the burning candle means that the man, Giovanni Arnolfini, was still alive when he was painted, while his wife was already dead. This only makes sense if the wife was not Giovanna Cenami but the more probable candidate, Constanza Trenta, who died in 1433. But why use a six-armed chandelier for this? Did Arnolfini have four other dead wives? The association of the candle burning in full daylight with the sanctuary lamp suggests that Giovanni's flame (i.e. life) is eternal while Constanza's life has ended completely with her earthly existence. Was she denied an afterlife in heaven? If so, why would the husband have commissioned such a loving portrait? Surely, Van Eyck could have come up with a better, less confusing way of showing that Giovanni was the surviving half of the pair. *If* he wanted to... For instance, the aforementionted pearly thing with the green tassels may not represent the Holy Ghost, but it may indicate that the husband is still among the living. It forms an unequal pair with the sweep or brush hanging on the wife's side of the mirror. It's like a single, large and 'dead' version of the 'living' green tassels. On the other hand, the dead woman's dress is the same kind of green... Adding to the confusion is the colouring of the brush's handle. Red and blue, like the 'ring' in the mirror that might represent the Holy Ghost.

So, what would it mean if that handle is a reflection of the Holy Ghost? I don't know...           
I'm more confident about the meaning of the chandelier.

            caption="The 'dark' chandelier and candle" %}

I have an idea about the chandelier that I haven't come across elsewhere. One that fits with both the somewhat sad, 'dark' state of the chandelier and the suspicion that the mirror represents the Holy Trinity. The name 'Lucifer' says it all. As you probably know, it means 'light-bringer' or 'light-bearer'. Which is a little odd for someone considered to be the equivalent of the Prince of Darkness and the Antichrist. If such an evil character bears/brings light, there must be something wrong with it. It must be like a will-o'-the-wisp, leading respectable souls astray. Or in another sense not very useful to mankind. Light that is superfluous, like in this case, where braod daylight makes candlelight unnecessary. While at night, that same single, grey candle probably wouldn't bring enough light to be of much help. Most of the light coming from the elaborate and expensive chandelier is reflected daylight. With its six brass arms it appears to rival the mirror/sun with its ten Passion rays. This, too, fits with the chandelier representing Lucifer. The fallen angel is associated with the planet Venus, also known as the morning star. It rises before the sun, bringing some light to the world. But that weak light is soon completely 'overshadowed' by the light of the rising sun. Hold that celestial thought.

First I'd like to strengthen my assertion that the chandelier is Luciferian. Note, for instance, the ends of the six arms. They're crowns. When you turn the chandelier 180 degrees, the six crowns are part of a larger crown-like form. The Dutch word for this object is appropriate: 'kroonluchter', the equivalent of 'crown lighter'. Van Eyck may have used the Middle Dutch word 'luchtere' (attested in the early 15th century), the nomen agentis of the verb 'luchten' – 'to give light'. So in a sense, Lucifer, the bringer/bearer of light, might also be called 'luchter(e)'.

Six crowns in one big crown suggest a double trinity: *sex personae, una substantia*, to paraphrase Tertullian. Or, one king with six aspects. Like the pope's tiara, the multiple crown also says: this is no ordinary king – this is a king of kings. Ironically, the papal tiara has evolved out of a simple Phrygian cap, a headdress shaped like the cone of... a candle extinguisher. The Arnolfini chandelier can be seen as the final stage of the tiara's development – and, by extension, of the papacy. The early popes were like their humble Phrygian caps: extinguishers of Lucifer's false candlelight. But the cap became a crown, the crown became a double crown, and finally a triple crown. (Not to mention the circlets and diadems that went into it.) The more elaborate the former cap became, the more it changed from a candle extinguisher into a chandelier, spreading the false light that it used to extinguish...

When you disregard the arms, you notice that the central 'body' of the chandelier actually does look like a papal tiara. The chandelier is like a papal tiara that has sprouted six branches. Perhaps Van Eyck has seen pictures of popes similar to the relatively crude example from the *Liber chronicorum*. All the popes depicted in that book wear the tiara, even when they didn't, like the early pope Anterus. The protruding parts of the three crowns look like leaves; suggesting that the tiara can grow even further, like a tree. This could make the chandelier a model for the papal tiara of the future. (From Van Eyck's point of view, of course.) If the Church continues in the direction it has taken, at some point the added power and pomp will be reflected in a papal tiara that looks like this chandelier. 

The chandelier may represent the future 'multi-crown' of the pope, but it may also represent the present 'multi-crown' of Lucifer. Another 'king of kings', who, like the pope, is considered powerful enough to depose or install kings. If you identify Lucifer with Satan (no problem at all, as far as I'm concerned), you only have to think about the Temptation of Christ. Satan takes Jesus to the top of 'a very high mountain', "and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me." (Matt. 4:8-9) 

In my opinion it's not an either/or proposition; I think that the chandelier represents both a present and a future crown. The idea being that the pope's increasing power means that he will become increasingly like the Satan/Lucifer on the very high mountain. If this was also Van Eyck's idea, it is like a much more subtle and better-drawn ancestor of the Protestant depictions of the pope as the Antichrist. 

The more familiar 'cherry' on top of the papal tiara is the *globus cruciger*, symbolizing Christ's dominion over the orb of the world. However, the tiara topped with just a sphere is also common. It can be seen, for instance, in the commemorative coin of Eugenius IV, the ruling pope when Van Eyck painted *The Arnolfini Portrait*.

In images like this it's not unusual to see the tiara sticking into something above a certain border. No doubt the border between heaven and earth. Ergo: you need a tiara, you have to be the Vicar of Christ, to be able to establish this heavenly connection. Oddly, pope Anterus's little tiara orb has crossed the border of his halo, suggesting that it has gone beyond the heavenly sphere. It looks like a ring, which is exactly what our chandelier tiara has in place of an orb. This may have a special significance here, but it doesn't have to. Although I don't quite see the function of this ring, it is not uncommon in chandeliers. I do understand the need for a ring at the top, to hang the chandelier on the ceiling. Sometimes you see rings at the top and at the bottom, like in Meckenem's copper engraving *The Lute Player and the Harpist*. This chandelier also hangs above a seemingly harmonious pair: a woman playing the harp, and a man (with **very** pointy shoes) playing the lute.

  The rings on both ends suggest that the chandelier can also be hung upside down. Although it doesn't seem very practical. Like the Arnolfini chandelier the Meckenem chandelier has crown-like forms underneath the candles, and in the middle a fifth crown that isn't upside down. There's an eye to the left of the base of the longest of the four candles. This (all-)seeing eye appears to be opposed by an eye that is not seeing, because it is obstructed by the left leg of the M shape beneath the fifth crown. On top of that M, directly below that crown I see a smaller pair of eyes. My guess is that they reflect the respective strengths of the evil, unseeing eye to the left and the good, all-seeing eye to the right. The harmony of the music/marriage below may be linked to the dominant force in the 'fifth' king. 

  Meckenem may have combined in the chandelier what Van Eyck divided over the chandelier and the mirror. The Arnolfini chandelier is not hanging on a ring. The best available reproduction has cut off a bit from the top of the painting, so I had to resort to a lesser but more complete reproduction to show how the chandelier is attached. And since it's pretty dark up there, I have lightened the details.

            caption="The T on top of the chandelier" %} 

So apparently the thing is suspended on two mouse grey knots at the end of two threads. The knots are like two fluffy eyeballs beneath a long monobrow formed by a straight, dragonesque snake. Head on the left, tail on the right. Although that tail could also be a head – a snake's head. As a double-sided animal it seems to be made be two adjoining gargoyles on top of a church spire. Not quite the right location for gargoyles. Just like the chandelier itself is not quite like the then-present papal tiara... Together, 'gargoyles' and 'spire' form a big letter T. Or, two L's of *Lucifer* with a shared stem? Mweh... Even so, that doesn't make the more obvious T go away. What might that T stand for? If the chandelier is indeed evil, then the T could stand something that could destroy the Arnolfini marriage: *Temptation*.

In Middle Dutch the word was also spelled with a t – 'temptacie'. And in Latin it is, of course, *tentatio*. Given the fact that the inscription between the chandelier and the mirror is in Latin, this could be the main language used in the painting. Why would the T stand for *Tentatio* rather than, say, *Tenebris* ('darkness')? *Tenebris* is apt well, given the relatieve darkness in the area above the chandelier. A darkness that, strangely, is hardly broken by the light of the one burning candle. So, it could be *Tenebris* as well, but not just *Tenebris*, IMO. We've already seen a hint of the third temptation of Christ (according to Matthew). The many crowns in the chandelier that, via the pope's deposing and crowning power, can refer to the kingdoms that Satan/Lucifer gives away for worship. In the church spire that forms the stem of the T I see a reference to the second temptation of Christ (again following Matthew's order of events). "Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." (Matt. 4:5-6)

In the Statenvertaling (1637), the Dutch equivalent of the King James bible, 'a pinncle of the temple' is translated with 'de tinne des tempels'. Two more T words... 'Tinne' is a Middle Dutch word meaning 'battlement, crenelation'. And that's exactly what can be seen around the base of the spire.

            caption="The battlements of the temple" %} 

If the chandelier refers to two out of three temptations of Christ, one might expect a reference to the third one as well. The first one, according to Matthew, came when Jesus was hungry after fasting forty days and nights in the wilderness. "And when the **Tempter** came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
" (Matt. 4:3-4) I don't see any stones in the chandelier, but you might say that its branches and thorny protrusions are like a wilderness. In fact, the chandelier can be neatly divided into the settings of the three temptation attempts.

            class="image-center"
            caption="The chandelier of Temptation" %}   

The brown wilderness of T1 flanks the blue mountain of T3, turned upside down beneath the golden temple tower of T2. That tower is higher than the 'very high' mountain, unless you subtract the red Temptation T from the temple. Then the tower is as high as the mountain (cum tiara in the chandelier body) minus the red head with the ring at the bottom. This suggests a link between that fiery head and the T. This link could be that the head is the head of the chandelier beast and the T its tail. The T may also say something about the identity of the head's owner. Given the now obvious references to the scenes of the three temptations of Christ, it is likely that apart from *Temptation* the T can also stand for *Tempter*, as the devil/Satan/Lucifer is named when he first appears before Jesus. The word used in the Early New Dutch of the Statenvertaling is 'verzoeker' (compare German 'Versucher'), but a bible translator in Van Eyck's time may have used the Middle Dutch 'tempterer' or one of its variants, 'tempteerre' and 'tempteerder'. In the Vulgate the tempter is called *tentator*.  

The advantage of *Tentator* is that it's a good umbrella term for all the big baddies: Satan, Lucifer, Antichrist etc. It's certainly useful here because the chandelier integrates the devil/Satan of the temptation with Lucifer the light-bringing morning star. The *Tentator*'s head looks more Luciferian than Satanic: it's like the head of a bat with lion's manes.

            caption="The batlike Morning Star shines" %}   

Some bat grey can be seen in the eyebrows, and the two threads with which 'he' hangs on the ceiling. Lucifer had been described and depicted with battish characteristics long before this painting. It is said that when he fell from heaven his angel's wings turned into bat wings. Dante's described them like this:

>*Beneath each face of his, two wings spread out,
as broad as suited so immense a bird:
I’ve never seen a ship with sails so wide.*

>*They had no feathers, but were fashioned like
a bat’s; and he was agitating them,
so that three winds made their way out from him—* <br><span style="float: right; font-size: smaller;">(Inf. 34.46-51)</span> 
<br>

Since Dante's Lucifer has three faces, he has six wings – the same number of arms/wings like our Lucifer in the chandelier. A few years earlier, Giotto had painted flying demons with batlike wings in one of his scenes in the life of St. Francis. They have just two each, so it's not surprising that Lucifer got more. His six wings, two for each of his three *personae*, suggest that the chandelier opposes the Holy Trinity of the mirror with an unholy trinity. Dante's threefold Lucifer is made of what he considered the greatest traitors in human history: Brutus, Cassius and Judas. Van Eyck's chandelier trinity has different aspects. The theme here isn't treason but temptation. So if 'Tentator' is opposed to God, the three *personae* may be Tentator Satan/devil, Tentator Lucifer, and Tentator Antichrist. This trichotomy is, however, less obvious than the one we've already seen, that of the temptation locations. This may suffice, but I'm curious to see if those persons are present. Lucifer certainly is, with the batlike appearance of the chandelier. And the Antichrist? You might say that the crowns in the chandelier, directed against suffering Christ in the mirror, are the opposite of His crown of thorns. Since the prefix *anti* means 'against', the fact alone that the chandelier is pointed against the Christian mirror is enough to call it anti-Christian. 

And the devil? He may be hiding in the details...

            class="image-center"
            caption="The devil's eye?" %}   

It now seems even more likely that Meckenem's engraving was inspired by the *Arnolfini
Portrait*, as there's an eye hidden in the 'wilderness' on the left of the 'mountain'. This eye, pointed out by the white arrow, may form a pair with the much flatter eye-like shape near the yellow arrow. This possible left eye also seems to be part of a skull in the aperture next to the more realistic eye. That small skull could be part of a long, devilish head, partly coinciding with one of the crowns, behind the brass arms. The red arrow points to one of several cornicular protrusions, while the green arrow points to the tip of the possible goatee. The big eye corresponds with the seeing left eye in the Meckenem chandelier. I hesitate to call it all-seeing and divine now, since it appears that he had lifted this eye from Van Eyck's chandelier – an eye that, given the unholy context, can hardly be all-seeing and divine. As in Meckenem's chandelier there's an unseeing eye opposed to the seeing one. There it is unseeing because it is obstructed, here it is unseeing because it's hollow – the apple of the eye is missing. Like the seeing eye the unseeing one is connected to a crown in the back of the chandelier.

            caption="The seeing and unseeing eye of Van Eyck's chandelier" %}    

I'm afraid that my interpretation of the eyes in the Meckenem chandelier is of much use anymore. And certainly not of use in explaining the similar pair in the Van Eyck chandelier. The eyes turn it into a huge head (with a T on top). This head could be the head of the threefold Tentator, composed of the three 'persons' but who are also equal to the whole. If the devil's face adds the (seeing) right eye to the Tentator head, then the Antichrist may add the (unseeing) left eye. Unlike Satan/the devil he doesn't appear to have a head of his own of which this blind eye is a part. Instead, the eye appears to add a scrotum to a phallic candle.                  

{% include image.html

            caption="The scrotal eye" %}    

The greyish wax is cut off from view in such a way that it looks like the light head of a brass penis. The association of the blind eye with a phallic form could mean that the blindness is the blindness of the mind when a being is dominated by the body, and busy satisfying its needs. This excessive physicality can be called anti-Christian, because the Word should be primary, not the flesh. 

The blind eye is can also be seen as the reflection of the simple fact that this right side of the chandelier is significantly darker than the left side, which obviously profits more from the light outside. (Although, seen from the Tentator point of view this may not be regarded as 'profit'.) As the darkest side of the chandelier, the right side can be considered most antithetic to the Light of the World and therefore the most anti-Christian. So this side is most likely dominated by Tentator Antichrist. Except for the fact that his name isn't 'Antichrist', I can't think of any reason why Satan/the devil is more 'enlightened' than the Antichrist. It is mainly the devilish head in the left side and the batlike head in the center that makes me think that Satan/the devil is dominant in the left side of the chandelier and that Lucifer dominates the center.

Being a trinity, the three *personae* are also one (sunstance). Meaning, I think, that the head of Tentator, the big chandelier head, represents the face of all three components. A face with one working eye (thanks to the daylight) and one blind eye. Why the unequal pair, that Meckenem deemed important enough to use in his chandelier? Why was light used to differentiate between the three evil *personae*? Perhaps to show that darkness is seldom complete and evil seldom pure. And perhaps to suggest that the duality between the good mirror and the evil chandelier isn't so absolute. Apart from this, I can think of two other possible reasons for the eye situation. 

First, it could refer to the saying 'In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king'. Erasmus had recorded a Latin version in his *Adagia* (*in regione caecorum rex est luscus*), and perhaps Van Eyck before him was aware of it. Perhaps he even knew the much older version from the Genesis Rabbah: "In the street of the blind, the one-eyed man is called the Guiding Light". King or Guiding Light, both fit the chandelier Tentator, the bringer of weak and/or false light. It fits Lucifer the Morning Star, whose light pales in comparison to the light of the sun. 

Second, the Dajjal, the Islamic equivalent of the Antichrist has one blind eye and one seeing eye. Bukhari, via Malik ibn Anas, tells us: "The Prophet Mohammed said, 'No prophet was sent, but that he warned His followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord [Allah] is not so. And there will be written between his eyes the word *kafir*."[^1] In other hadiths the blind eye, usually the right one, is said to be like a protruding grape. In the chandelier it's the apple of the seeing (right) eye that looks more like a grape. Especially because the shape of the head around it is not unlike that of a bunch of grapes. 

Although it's not very likely that Van Eyck read Islamic texts in his spare time, with the expanding Ottoman Empire knocking on the door of Belgrade at the time he may have heard something about the Islamic Antichrist. Perhaps even from Arnolfini himself. On the other had, if he wasn't aware of Dajjal, or of the saying, he may simply have had the idea that seems to be the basis for the Dajjal's ocular condition: to contrast him with Allah the All-Seeing. 

I certainly can't see *kafir* or just *k.f.r.* written between Tentator's eyes. The two openings in the body are plus signs rather than letters. Plusses with horizontal bars that have dropped a little from the middle, making them seem like two Latin crosses turned upside down, like the Cross of Saint Peter, who supposedly was crucified upside down. Being symbols of the first pope, the two openings can be considered a reference to the Church. An *extra* reference, since they are part of the papal tiara-like form in the chandelier, and this is underneath the spire and the battlement of the temple. The two visible embrasures in that battlement are shaped like a trifolium, a symbol of the Holy Trinity. It is telling that these four Christian symbols are just small, empty spaces within a mass of brass.

Battlements are usually associated with the walls of castles. The 'holy' symbols in the embrasures suggest that the Church has become a Castle. Meaning, that the pope has become more like a secular leader, getting the Papal States involved in wars, just like a regular king and his kingdom. The two Petrine Crosses beneath the battlement confirm this degeneration of the Church into a military power, because they also look like eye-slits in a brass helmet. A helmet that largely coincides with the papal tiara in the chandelier, and with that temple tower on top of it, it's fit for a church knight. 

Like the extended tiara, the papal helmet may point to a future situation rather than depict Van Eyck's present. The idea being, again, that the Church is on its way to become identical with the Tentator. In other words, the body of Christ is transforming into the body of Satan. (Or the Antichrist, or Lucifer.) And with warrior popes like Julius II the worst was indeed to come...    

(*Kafir*, by the way, means 'infidel'. This was also the term used for the crusading Franks. Those knights wore helmets not unlike the helmet in the chandelier. So in a sense there may be *kafir* 'written' between the anti-Chtistian eyes after all.)

Slowly but certainly the meaning of the Arnolfini chandelier has become clear. A few more details need to be addressed before its relationship to the mirror will be examined. One of these is still rather puzzling to me. When you zoom into the supposed goatee of the supposed devil in the chandelier, you see this cute little creature:                   
{% include image.html

            caption="Baby bat in the goatee?" %}       

It may take a while before you see it. It helps to know that the white arrow point at its somewhat triangular right eye. Its left eye is on the same height, in the center of a head that seems to be suppressed by an arch in the chandelier arm above it. The arch clearly pushes down the creature's left ear. A hint of a nose can be seen below the right eye. My impression is that of a wingless baby bat. While the arch gives its head form, its lower end appears to be disintegrating. Without the pressure of an arch it seems formless. Very strange... 

At the moment I can only explain this life form in light of the chandelier as part Church or the future Church. If the head of the Church is becoming more and more like Lucifer (et al), then the battish creature below the arch, low in the chandelier, may represent the lower clergy. Formed by the Church, and in its clutch, but relatively innocent and relatively far removed from the *tentatorial* Roman Curia. The lack of (bat) wings can stress both its innocence and its dependence on the 'Mother church'. Without the grip of the arch it might fall down... onto the mirror. The Passion 'ray' in which Jesus takes up the cross, to be precise. That possible fall would be like, but also very *unlike* Lucifer's fall from heaven. And what's perhaps even stranger than the creature itself is that the potential fall's trajectory can already be seen. (Passing the orange arrows.)

It looks like a long, unintended 'fault line', but I haven't seen a similar crack in the painting, and when you look closely there's a clear difference with the craquelure around it. For one thing, the line is dotted with 'patches' like the one pounted at by the pink arrow. For another, it's cut in three practically equal parts by the swirls of Van Eyck's inscription. The middle part, between the calligraphy, looks thinner and more crack-like than the parts that comnect to the mirror and the chandelier. (The upper half of the upper segment even takes on the colouring of the baby bat.) This thinning suggests that chandelier/mirror connection is hindered by the inscription. Meaning, perhaps, by Van Eyck himself.

Why would he do that?! Is it a good thing or a bad thing? Is this what the inscription is about? (*Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434* – "Jan van Eyck was here 1434".) Does that *hic* refer to the place between the chandelier and the mirror, and in particular to the place between the cross-bearing Jesus and the dangling baby bat (lower clergy)? Is is some sort of confession? "I was here, messing with this line." I call it a 'lifeline' in the caption to the above images of it, because it's the only connection between the chandelier and the mirror. If you consider the chandelier as a symbol of a Church that has become Luciferian, a corrupt Body of Christ, then the opposing mirror could represent the Spirit or Soul of Christ. In that view, that 'lifeline' indicates how far removed the Church is from true Christianity: it's hanging on to it by a thread. And even that thread is threatened. By a 'fork' with Jan van Eyck's name on it. And perhaps also an image of the artist as a fish...

            caption="Fishy J" %}

After tilting the image 90 degrees to the right, it becomes clear that the signature is shaped like a two-pronged (pitch)fork. Its business end consists of a calligraphic part that looks like some sort of musical notation, and a larger part (the J) that looks like a fish. The little red arrow points to its right eye. Below it is a V-shaped mouth that seems interested in have a bit of that 'notation'. So apparently it is J.'s hunger that forms the fork that threatens the thread. 

In those days the fork still had a bad name. The three-pronged model in particular. It was associated with the devil, and demons used them for their prodding. God gave you fingers to eat with, so using a fork instead of those God-given fingers is an insult to His creative work. That was the idea, I think. And so the image of the fork adds weight to the suspicion that *Johannes de eyck* being there was not a good thing. Was he their, being demonic, in 1434, and in a different place when he painted *The Arnolfini Portrait*? That could mean that he painted it after 1434. Unless, of course, he repented in the same year. 

What did he do wrong? What did he do that weakened the tie between the Church and its origin? If you indeed consider the chandelier to be the body of Christ and the mirror His soul/spirit/ghost/whatever, then the fork attack, by aiming to divide the two, can be called an assassination attempt. Feeling guilty of a crime against Christ, Van Eyck may have felt compelled to confess it in a painting. But why in this particular painting? Because it is about marriage? Did the painted joining of a man and a woman give him a good reason to add a painted confession of his attempt to *divorce* (simply put) Jesus Christ and the Church? 

This is what He said (to the Pharisees) about divorce: 
>Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, <br />And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? <br />Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <span style="float: right; font-size: smaller;">(Matt. 19:4-6)</span>

While the Arnolfini's are 'cleaving' to each other by their hands, above them the painter of their portrait is 'cleaving' the Christian lifeline. If the woman is Constanza Trenta, man and wife were no longer 'one flesh' in 1434. Van Eyck had joined what God had put asunder. Is this the sin that he is confessing with his fork? I doubt it. I don't see what this has to do with the Church. My guess is that Van Eyck's mistake lies outside this painting. 

What's clear is that the cause is some kind of hunger. If the fishy J wasn't interested in having a bite of the *notation*, there would have been no fork. The snapping mouth of the J and the fork itself say: "A man's gotta eat..." But was he so hungry that the black snake-like triplets in front of him looked appetizing? I guess they do, because the h, indicated by the orange arrow in the below image, appears to be a cross between the J and just such a 'snake' with a rectangular head.   

{% include image.html

            class="image-center"
            caption="Hungry J and snaky h" %}     

Rather than eating the snake *notation* the h suggests 'communion' with it. So does the *CI* between the triplets and the h. The phallic I, in line with the lower jaw of the J fish, 'penetrates' a vaginal C. The yellow arrow points to a thin line on top of that C. It points to the I and the triplets, and makes the C look like a T with a crooked stem or the mirror image of a small J. The *CI* can stand for *Christus Iesus*. The flipped initials and the crooked T in the C can make it the *Tentator* kind of Christ, His mirror image: the Antichrist. Finally, the small J in mirror image suggests that the communion is internal: between the Christian and the anti-Christian *Johannes de eyck*. The Christian Jan is tempted by the anti-Christian one, and, unlike Jesus, Jan couldn't resist. He couldn't say "Get thee hence, Satan" – instead he *approached* the devil inside him. If the triplets represent the three temptations, Jan goes for the lowest of the three, which could be the third one. Which is the one about the kingdoms, according to Matthew; about the jumping from the temple, according to Luke.

Between the triplets and the collection of small rectangles (similar to the heads of the little tempting snakes) a C-shaped eyelike form can be discerned. The also C-shaped eye of the J fish appears to be looking at it. This is suggested by the kinked little line connecting the ends of that C. Its bolder upper part can represent the upwardly directed pupil of the fish eye. The fish is looking at his very own *Tentator*.

Given my association of this part of the signature fork with musical notation, the devilish head formed by it also looks strangely musical. In the 1430s the devil probably had the best tunes as well. Was the J fish first attracted by his deceptively sweet music? 

The calligraphic devil has one visible, hook-like horn above the group of little rectangles (between the white arrows) that form the forehead. Perhaps they represent the devil's brain? Heavy eyebrows? Either way, the similarity of the little rectangles with the heads of the tempting triplets suggests that the area between the horn and the eye is the place where snaky temptations are born. Or where their heads are stored. Each temptation snake seems to be made of a head from the 'brain' and a body from the horn above it. The bodies of the triplets are like three smaller horns with (thinner) extensions. Because these horn lines are extended these bodies look more like the 'horn' of the J fish. Its tail also continues and crosses itself, forming almost an 8. The fact that the fish is curling his tail like the triplets can be regarded as a sign that he is biting and by succumbing to the (third) temptation is becoming like them – evil. By the way, rather than eights the triplets seem to form sixes (in mirror image).

As a whole the J fish looks like a horn, too. Like an empty cornucopia, to be precise. Bound together with three *I*'s, of which the largest is indicated by the orange arrow in the following image on the left. The red arrow points to a similar cornucopia binding.

According to Ovid and others the horn of plenty once belonged to a mythic goat (Amalthea). So what we see in the 'pointy' part of the (pitch)fork are two (parts of) goats looking each other in the eye. And perhaps, like the fish, the devilish part is also both partly and wholly horn. The shape of the triplets does suggest the opening of a horn. However, I prefer the idea that they complement each other. On the left we have a horn without plenty and on the right we see (below the shorter, already desginated devil's horn) plenty without horn. This 'plenty' would then comprise: the inner devil's 'brain', his eye, the triplets, and perhaps the *C[T/J]I* below it. If the latter forms the devil's mouth, the triplets should represent his nose. If, on the other hand, the C[T/J]I* forms the lower jaw, the triplets could form both the nose and the mouth. The head of the lower snakelet is like a little square mouth. And the heads of the two snakelets above it may represent the holes of the nose. 

Whatever are the appointed nose and mouth, another intriguing thing about the calligraphic head's anatomy is that the eye appears to be to the 'brain' what the *C[T/J]I* is to the triplets. It suggests that one set develops from the other: that the *C[T/J]I* is formed from the eye and the triplets from the 'brain' – and/or the other way round. The developing of the triplets and the *C[T/J]I* can then be seen as the equivalent of the approach of the tempter in Matt. 4:3. 

Continuing along the complementary line, you might say that on the one hand you have a good but skinny goat and on the other a bad, fat goat. The relative goodness of the J is suggested by its fishiness. Jesus and fish are associated, most notably by the ichthys symbol. The three *I*'s binding the 'horny' J fish can be seen as I's of the Latin *Iesus*. And if you look closely, you can see that these light binding I's are formed by dark J's. The three bindings may refer to the popular etymology of *religion*, but also to the light yoke of Christ. The largest one, around the neck, still leaves some room for the widening of the mouth. But otherwise they seem to prevent J from splitting himself in two in order to fill himself with plenty. The strength of those three bindings can therefor be seen as a measure of J's Christian strength. His strength to resist temptation. So the slight looseness in the neck reflects his loosening morals. For the J horn to become a horn of plenty, the bindings *need* to loosen up. Otherwise the horn can't be filled.

This all reminds me of the dilemma that has pestered professional artists throughout the ages. Hold on to your lofty principles and starve, or sell out and eat. One way of dealing with this is to do what Van Eyck seems to be doing here: eat, and be sorry. To tell in a hidden way what you **really** think. In the same commission that caused the moral pain, or, as it seems the case here, in another work.

The tail of the J fish is more akin to the triplets than I noted earlier. It happens to be threefold as well. The tail consists of three strings waving in the murky water of the back wall. The longest is the central near-8. The white arrow in the image below points to the hook-like black C where it ends. Below it ends the upper string (indicated by the red arrow). Slightly to the right of that end point a short 'substring' has split off, also pointing towards said end point. The result is that the final part of the upper string looks a bit like the upper part of a skull, pushing against the 'lifeline' bothered by Jan's name fork. Also worth noting is that this string is the mirror image of an S. The skull in its top could mean that this S could be the initial of the skull's owner...

            caption="Loose, triple tail fin" %}             

While the 'S string' doesn't cross the lifeline at all, the third tail string crosses it no less than three times; ending near the blue arrow. The near-8 crosses the line twice, even though it's much longer than the lower string. If the tail strings are also evil like the triplets and intent on dividing the lifeline, then you'd expect the near-8 to be more divisive than the lower string. The reason that it isn't could be the H indicated by the upper orange arrow. The other orange arrow points to a smaller H in the lower string. Two details that for centuries must have been disregarded as meaningless parts of the signature. Now they are **Clues**. Take a look above the yellow arrow. This is where the cornucopia (*cornupenuria* would be more apt here) disintegrates into the three strings. Unlike the two binding *I*'s above it, the one in the tail has to tolerate the intrusion of its 'light' interior by two little lines. The one in the middle is the 'source' of the near-8 string, and the one above it is the start of the S string. To the left of this binding a row of two or three H's can be seen.

            caption="Losing control: <span style='font-style: italic;'>I</span> becomes <span style='font-style: italic;'>H</span>" %}      

They appear to be two or three inferior bindings. Inferior because the near-8 string runs through them, suggesting that these bindings can't control it. The upper two *I* bindings at least appear to control the lines by going *around* the cornupenuria. The third one doesn't; it looks like it was cut like a band holding a bunch of flowers. From this apparent point of *no control* the H phase next to it shows bindings that don't control but are controlled by what should be controlled. 

So, what does this mean for the two H's (indicated by the orange arrows) in the separated strings? At first I thought that the H in the near-8 still showed some Christian binding power, because it seemed to prevent that string from crossing/dividing the lifeline more often. The problem is that this wouldn't be consistent with the idea that the third *I* binding no longer has any binding power. Consistent with the transition to *H* bindings would be that the H's are anti-Christian bindings and as such work for the greater evil. This implies that the near-8 H is keeping that string together because it can do more harm that way. This would be the case if the main goal isn't to divide the lifeline as many times as possible but to *control* as much as possible of it. In that regard the near-8 string is the clear winner: the part of the lifeline stuck into its big mouth is longer than the two parts of the lifeline controlled by the lower string put together. The upper string does not control a part of the lifeline, but the S seems content with using his head to keep the lifeline in the near-8 mouth in line. The lower string appears the aid the main string by pushing a bit of lifeline (indicated by the white arrow in the following image) against the near-8.

The smaller H in the lower string doesn't appear to do anything. It certainly isn't holding lines together. Perhaps it is the equivalent of the useless third *I* binding, or it may be using its force of evil to bend the lower string. It may also have some function that currently eludes me... 

I doubt if it matters much, but the snaky S string seems H-less. Perhaps there's one in the tail (indicated by the yellow arrow). In the other end of the S there's an odd bit of light (encircled in white below). It appears to be part of an eye. A reason for its presence could be the need to make the top of the skull look like a (living) head in itself. A head that's threateningly facing the lifeline, whereas the semi-skull 'looks' in the direction of the transition area. Other than this I see no reason for an eye here, so it would be no disaster of closer study would reveal that the S string is eyeless after all.

The situation in the J fish tail is similar to the one in the head of the J fish. The yoke, the binding in the neck, shows some slack, enabling the head to open its mouth and succumb to the temptation. The third binding, in the tail, shows even more slack. So much so that, as I said, it doesn't seem to have any binding power. The result is an even larger widening in the tail beyond it. Where the top of the cornupenuria splits into two parts/jaws, its bottom splits into three parts/strings. So, if the divided top is bad enough to fall for the temptation, the even more divided bottom must be even worse. Bad enough, perhaps, to act like the triplets. If their goal was to divide the top of the cornupenuria, than the goal of the three equally snakelike tail strings must be the division of the lifeline. 

Is this evil within the 'good' goat/horn/fish/J inherent or is it caused by the fall of the top? Most likely it's a bit of both. Given the age-old Christian opposition between the pure soul and the sinful flesh, it's likely that the head is the best, the most spirtual part of the fish, and the tail the worst, most fleshy part. The more the mind is in control, the more the body is kept from sinning. Total control of the body by the mind would in this case translate to a tail that doesn't spread out like it does here. On the contrary, the tail would be completely bound by *I*'s. And of course it wouldn't bother the lifeline. Instead of weakening it, the right, dominating mind would rather order it to strengthen it. If the mind weakens, like that of Jesus in the desert, than its grip on the body weakens. And that first becomes apparent in the part that is farthest away from the head; the tail, where the body is already relatively strong. So the three strings reflect a rebellion of the body against a mind weakened by hunger.

The tension between mind and body, or rather body and soul, appears to be expressed in Jan's J as well. Because of its split top this particular J can be seen as the sum of an A in the upper half and a C in the lower half of the J. They could be the A of *Anima* ('soul') and the C of *Corpus* ('body'). The A becomes clearer when you turn the J 180 degrees.

            caption="J = AC" %}                       

The first *I* binding serves as its cross bar and the short, vertical line above middle of it – between the yellow arrow and the 'eyes' of the h and the o of *Johannes* – is the A's (black) eye. The second *I* binding marks the end of the A and the beginning of the C. Whether the C stretches from the orange arrow to the red or the pink arrow doesn't really matter. Either way the C shape is clear. But the fish/J doesn't end there. It continues with the three loose strings. In my view they are even more corporeal than the rest of the body, so how come they're not part of the C in the J? The answer to that question is that these strings can be said to be made of different kinds of C's that were 'stringed' together. And, like in the C-in-J, there are also a few I's in them. (The H's, for instance, are made of I's.) 


So there are many corporeal C's attached to the C of the J proper. This one C is less corporeal, because it is more bound by *I*'s than the string C's. There's a nice substantial symmetry in the whole fish/J, as there is not a single A opposed to the 'bound' C and the set of 'unbound' C's. There are two A's. There's a smaller A in the right leg of the large one.

            class="image-center"
            caption="A in A" %}   

The legs of this A in A are formed by the smaller 'mouth', the eye of the J fish. The eye of the A standing on those legs could be the tiny black dot, indicated by the green arrow. There's another one like it in the lower jaw of the fish (indicated by the white arrow), suggesting that there's an A in the left leg of the large A as well. An a with thinner legs and no eye between them. This makes the 'right leg A' special. Plus the fact that it coincides with the head of the fish. If the string C's in the tail represent the lowest, most physical part of the fish, the head A represents the most spiritual part of the fish. The ancients considered this part – call it *logos*, mind, *nous*, reason or intellect – to be the highest part of the soul. 

This set-up suggests two, maybe three opposing pairs. First, the whole *animal* A versus the whole *corporeal* C (being the 'bound' C plus the string C's in the tail). Second, the best versus the worst, i.e. the head A versus the string C's. Third, maybe, the lesser good versus the lesser evil, i.e. the lower jaw A versus the 'bound' C. Because the horn is empty, because the *cornu* is *penuria* instead of *copia*, the *Anima* has more trouble controlling the *Corpus*. The *Corpus* demands at least part of the plenty that the local Tentator has to offer. As I pointed out before, the J fish has turned its eye towards that Tentator's eye. But I didn't know then that there's another head in the fish head. The head A turns out to be a bird's head. The somewhat meek and humble look in the right eye of the fish is also an angry looking left eye in the bird's head.

The effect is again reached by a pupil-suggesting thickening in the line of the eye. The anger appears to be directed at the tail strings, and particularly the near-8. They seem like worms that the bird wants to eat but can't, because he is stuck, bound by the *I* bindings. The lower jaw of the fish, with its extension in the *C[T/J]I* (indicated by the white arrow), looks like the bird's left wing – also stuck and powerless.

The reason for this 'double address' – a bird's head looking at his own 'worms' and a fish head looking at the Tentator – could be a wish to stress J's ambivalence about the situation. On the one hand he's almost begging for the nourishment that the Tentator can give him. While on the other hand he wants correct the tail situation. If the fish is the J equivalent of God the Son, the (white) bird must be the J equivalent of God the Holy Ghost – bound, and hindered, by the flesh of the fishy J Jesus. Of course this doesn't mean much without a suitable God the Father to complete the Trinity. This is where the companion of the dot (acting as the eye of the A in A) comes in handy. Together they may form the eyes of the J equivalent of God the Father.

His mouth could be the first *I* binding or the central vertical line below it, indicated by the light blue arrow. As we've seen, this short line is also serving as the eye of the large *Anima* A. The orange arrow is pointing toward what could be God's nose. Of course this form coincides with the fish's mouth. Its beak-like shape is appropriate, because it makes God look like a cross between the fishy Son and the Holy Ghost (angry) bird. The nose/mouth/'space between bird's head and his wing' is also shaped like a letter V. A V that is part of the much larger V that is equal to the assumed threefold head above the first binding. (Or, the legs of the *Anima* A below the cross bar.) BTW, a 'holy' threefold head versus the 'unholy' trinitarian triplets does seem a fitting confrontation. 

Anyway, both or one of those V's could stand for 'Vader', the Duch and Middle Dutch word for 'Father'. The presence of God the Father (in J) is also hinted at by the *C[T/J]I* above the right side of the V. When you turn it 180 degrees (see the above image on the right), then it also appears to be a letter P. Possibly the P of *Pater* – 'Father'.

The letter stuff doesn't end there. The smaller contour V continues in the lower fish jaw, forming an angular letter S. This could be the S of the Middle Dutch *Sone* (or *Soon* or *Soin*) – 'Son'. The S extended with the I in the *C[T/J]I/P* shows some resemblance with an H. This H may stand for the Middle Dutch word for 'Holy', which could be 'Hillige' or several other variants, all starting with an H. The multifunctional *C[T/J]I/P* may also be involved in forming the letter G of *Gheest* ('Ghost'). The I in the *C[T/J]I/P*, the top of the H's right side, could be the (long) jaw of that G.

Admittedly, especially the H and G are not totally convincing. However, there is quite a convincing other reference to the Holy Ghost in the amazing *C[T/J]I/P/G*. From now on I'm calling it *CI* again, because this name is getting out of hand. Or should I just call it 'blackbird'?

            caption="Stylized 'G-bird'" %}  

An elegant, stylish little bird. The I represents the wings, or just the left wing. The yellow arrow points to a barely perceptible upside-down V: the sides of that tiny V are the legs with which the bird is standing on the J. The tip of the bigger, angry bird's wing, to be precise. The white arrow indicates the bird's crest. It's beak, on the other side, is pecking at the lowest of the triplets. 

Note the contrast with the J bird. The G-bird is small, black, and attacking a serpentine set larger than itself. The J-bird is relatively big, relatively light, and not attacking the thin serpentine tail strings – although the angry look suggests that it *wants* to attack them. Both seem powerless. In fact, if the G-bird's pecking at the triplets has any effect, it is to bring them closer to the J, the cornupenuria. That this is happening is suggested by the fact the bird-pecked triplet hangs lower than its two siblings. This would mean that the G-bird (formerly known as the *CI*) still has a rightful place in the devil's face in the evil side of Jan's fork. Presumably his mouth. The pecking that pushes the temptation triplets closer to the mouth of the J would then be equal to the Tentator's talking. 

How can being part of the evil anatomy be reconciled with the notion that the G-bird is the G of *Ghost* to the H of *Holy* in the fish? And why **two** 'holy' birds? 

I suppose the G-bird is a tragic little creature. It represents a Holy Ghost that has materialized (blackened) to such an extent that it thinks it is doing the right thing (attacking evil) but is incapable of realizing that by doing that it is actually furthering the cause of evil. It is inadvertently evil. Unwittingly it belongs more to the devil than to the J. It would be apt, if it does coincide with the devil's mouth. As a prime locus for the breath of life – i.e. the soul – it suggests that the G-bird has been reduced from *Logos* to mere *anima*. Its position in relation to the J's mouth also reminds one of the end of Jesus on the cross: "Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
" (Matt. 27:50) The fishy J, the also suffering 'horn of lack', does the same. But he gets something in return...

            caption="J gives up the ghost... and takes the plenty" %}              

Unlike Jesus the J isn't taken from the cross and buried in a tomb. At least not literally... The suffering of the J is not relieved by death but by the plenty needed to turn the cornupenuria into a cornucopia. (Ironically, the unbinding in the tail would probably mean a quick exit of the plenty from that end.) If the G-bird, the ghost given, has indeed been reduced to the status of common *anima*, we can see the exchange as J giving/'selling' his soul for plenty. 

I'm hesitant to add yet another letter to the G-bird formerly known as *CI*, but duty calls. Look at it from the angle in the image above, and see that the (almost) G is also a (almost) A. With a cross bar equal to the *I*/wing(s) and an underdeveloped right side. If you see the (letter) form as a G transforming into an A, it would be a good reflection of the Holy Ghost's degradation to just *Anima*. Unfortunately this letter transformation requires the not so elegant combination of Middle Dutch and Latin. 


More importantly, however, I think that the exchange is convincing. Jan van Eyck sells his soul for milk and honey. Milk and honey? Yes, these may be the prime ingredients of the *copia*. According to myth the goat Amalthea fed the infant Zeus in Crete with her milk, and bees brought him honey. So, since Amalthea's horn became the horn of plenty, there's a link between the cornucopia and young Zeus's diet. Van Eyck may be referring to it. I thought about this after realizing that the (degraded) ghost is not only given, it is also received. If the G-bird indeed forms the mouth of the devilish Tentator, than it seems that J is giving the devil the breath of life. Of course this immediately raises the question: if J brings the devil to life, how can the devil have tempted him into it? Not by using sweet, false words, as I suggested earlier, but simply by being *stuff*. *Stuff* that J craves. It is the plenty itself that is tempting, and by succumbing J breaths devilish life into this matter. 

So if J has given him a soul after succumbing to the temptation, the *notation* area between the eye and the horn can't be the brain where the devil's plan was hatched. Before J's fall it was also just stuff. A part of the plenty that looks like a honeycomb built with four-sided instead of six-sided cells.

            caption="The prong of milk and honey" %} 

Why four-sided? Perhaps because Van Eyck didn't want to be too obvious. Or because these cells look more like letters. Mostly like a bunch of E's sticking together. The relatively loose item indicated by the red arrow looks more like a d, though. A d that wants to become a capital D. Below it I see an I (above the yellow arrow) and a taller E (orange arrow) next to it. The Middle Dutch word for 'devil' is *duvel*, but the name was also spelled *dievel* and *divel*. So *d IE* could be the beginning of *dievel*.

The horn and the eye both appear to spring forth from the 'honeycomb', but it's also possible that the horn is primary. The branch on which the 'honeycomb' hangs, and formed, perhaps by having looser forms like the d, I and E sticking together. The eye is also a locus of the soul. And I must admit that, like the G-bird, it looks like a combined G-A. Plus, as I remarked before, it's situated beneath the four-sided cells like the G-bird beneath the triplets. So, if the eye really is an eye, this local Tentator may have been animated after all before the ghost was given. But is it 'really' an eye? The white arrow in the above image points to a thin line flowing from the supposed pupil. What is more likely: that it is a pupil leaking inky blackness, or that is the nipple of a breast, bringing forth snaky black milk? I would say the latter, if Van Eyck was indeed inspired by the myth of Amalthea and Zeus. If J is looking humble and hungry towards a breast instead of an eye, he would have *inspired* the devil with his spiritual gift. If it *is* an eye, the gift just adds to the devil's soul.    

I prefer the breast theory, because I think it's more fitting in this deal between *cornu* and *copia*. The arready living being needs dead matter (food) to survive; the dead matter receives a soul in return, and becomes alive. More important than my own preference is that what the honeycomb/notation also tells us. The fact is that this close-knit buch of E's are also a bunch of M's and A's.

Within this area two similar forms can be discerned: one related to the d, and the other one related to the IE. The lines in the 'd section' form the word *MAMMA* and *MAMA*. The two A's on the left and at the bottom are coloured purple. Two clear M's are blue. The left legs of these M's coincide with the right side of the large A. The third M can be seen below the two M's. It coincides with the bottom A minus its somewhat rudimentary right side. The left 'foot' of this' lower A is indicated by the white arrow. 

A similar odd A can be seen at the bottom of the 'IE section'. The lifeline goes right throught, and does look like mere damage here... If there's a *MAMMA* in this lower section, too, then it's less clear. The sense that one section has grown out of the other is confirmed by the 'section heads': the IE looks like the d with a stem that has leaked into an E. Which of course is also another M in the collection. The d, transformed into the IE, becomes part of the 'honeycomb'.

            caption="d adds M" %} 

The white dashed line divides the two parts of the 'honeycomb'. If we assume that the transformation goes from top to bottom, then the part below the dashed line shows the part above it after some time has elapsed. Then the d above the upper section has divided into that I and the E/M that is added to the other M's. This E/M, coloured orange, pushes the upper section down. The yellow arrows show that the top line of the first manifestation has moved down in the second manifestation. The I above the E/M, coloured blue, is the upper, non-stem part of the d after the transformation. The serifs on this I are so prominent that it can also pass for an H. Unlike the d, but like the E/M, this I/H is connected to the 'honeycomb'. This makes the part below the dashed line even longer – although it is also slightly less wide than the upper part.

But what does it all mean? 

It means two-fold support for my breast theory. First: the letters. Assuming that the lower section grows out of the upper section, the letters first appear to spell *d MAM[M]A* and then, less clearly, *IEMAM[M]A*, *HEMAM[M]A*, *IMMAM[M]A*, or *HMMAM[M]A*. Since the IE originated from the d, you might say that the d 'contains' the IE and can be seen as the abbreviation of 'dIE'. The Middle Dutch word *die* functioned both as a demonstrative and an article. So 'dIE MAM[M]A' can be read as 'this mom' or 'the mom'. The problem, however, is that neither *mama* or *mamma* is in the Middle Dutch dictionary. Although the words may have been used by children to designate their mother, as it was done in Latin. For Latin-speaking grown-ups *mamma* meant 'a breast, pap, esp. of females, rarely of males; also, a teat, dug of animals.' So children used 'mamma' as a *pars pro toto*. Mother was named after the *pars* that fed the child and thereby kept it alive.

The Latin *mamma* became the Middle Dutch *mamme* '(female) breast'. In Early New Dutch – that is, from around 1500 – this word also came to mean 'mother, nurse'. Could the lower A be the e of *mamme*? When you zoom in on its problematic right side, there does appear to be an E in it.  

{% include image.html

            class="image-center"
            caption="Mammie?" %}              

This E (indicated by the white arrow) is preceded, however, by what looks like an I (indicated by the yellow arrow). *Mammie*?! As far as I know that's no variant of *mamme*. But I before E is something we've seen before – at the head of the lower section, the result of the d's transformation. This 'new', less conspicuous IE may represent a similar division. Perhaps to show change within the changing section. If it means that the lower A has become untenable as an A, that wouldn't be the end of *MAM[M]A*. Proper, if squarish A's can be picked at will from the three-story 'M building'. And since those M's can also function as E's, it is also possible to form *MAMME*, or its variant *MEMME*. 

So, in Middle Dutch the upper section can read *d MAMME [ie]* – 'the breast', or, supposing the *pars pro toto* to be in effect at the time, 'the mother, nurse'. In Latin we can read the section as *d MAMMA [ie]* and have the same meaning. Except that then d[ie] has to be someting other than a demonstrative or an article. In Latin *die* is a form of *dies*, 'day'. *Die mammam*, which can be formed with the available letters, means 'Mothers Day'. I think it's more likely that the d stands for some form of the verb *dare*. *Dare mammam* means 'to suckle, nurse'. 

Another possibility is that the d stands for *deus* or *dei*, 'god' in the nominative and genitive case, respectively. The breakup of the d into IE suggests that, like *dIE*, the d also holds *dEI*. Then we can read the upper section as *dei mamma* – 'Mother of God'. 

This would fit with the myth: the goat Amalthea acting as the mother of Zeus by suckling him. And it would fit with J – with his Trinitarian head – being the Zeus of this signature story.

            caption="Dear Mammo..." %} 

J looks in the direction of *MAMMA*, and sees a breast. For him, too, the mother seems to be no more than a breast on two legs. As Zeus looked upon the goat Amalthea, the divine infant called J looks upon this calligraphic goat. In this mother and child view of the scene there is very little need for temptation. It's as though J too young, or too blinded by need that he isn't even aware of any temptation. The triplet milk flows from the breast into his mouth. 

The Latin word *MAMMA* above the eyelike form makes a strong argument for the assertion that is not an eye but a breast. The transformation from one section of the 'honeycomb' into the other makes it even stronger. This is the second leg that supports the breast theory. 

A single section of rectangles saying *MAMMA* would have sufficed. Van Eyck added another one, slightly less readable, less recognizable as letters. And then out of that section comes a breast that looks like a capital letter G. On the other hand, the upper section comes forth from the large, C-like horn. The change I see reminds me of John 1:14: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth." J beholds the 'glory' of a word made flesh. Here the word 'MAMMA' becomes the piece of flesh that it refers to: a breast. The letters 'leaking' into other letters or less readable suggest a downward softening. And so does the development from the hard horn to the soft breast. Although the horn has a similar, G-like shape.

The 'softening' continues on the way down. From the fleshy breast flows the snaky milk that feeds J, who in return adds the even less tangible soul (and mouth, and G-bird). A breast fits perfectly in this development from the most to the least tangible. An eye is corporeal as well, but its association with the soul makes it fit less well. So my conclusion is that J animates the 'maternal' devil.      

Maternal? Not entirely. Only in the phase of the face related to the breast: from the word for it to the breast itself. The snaky milk and the G-bird below it form a zone that is rather *animal*. In more than one sense as far as the G-bird, the devil's new *anima*, is concerned. And the horn above the maternal zone? The large C shape suggests that we call the hardest zone 'corporeal'. May we also call it 'paternal'? Lets tilt the signature 90 degrees to the left and have a closer look at that horn.

            caption="The corporeal zone (l) and the inverted devil (r)" %} 

The horn looks like a large G constructed by sticking a small C to a much larger C. Although a breast doesn't fit in this hard phase it does look breast-ish. And, more worrying, the red arrow points to a patch of light that hints at a nipple. It could also be a wart on the giant, caricatural nose formed by the horn. This impression is strengthened by the d, indicated by the yellow arrow, which from this angle looks like a left eye and an eyebrow. The I of the IE above it suggests a left ear. The 'honeycomb' above it now looks like a row of buildings. Or like a three-story crown on the elliptical 'horn-head' with the humongous nose. Perhaps a... tiara? 

The blue arrow points at its top. In images of the pope we often see the top of the tiara passing the border between heaven and earth. Here we see that the top of the 'tiara' is the only part above the lifeline. The breast is sticking out of the tiara like a short bishop's staff. 

Judging from the available images of Eugene IV this is not a portrait of the then-ruling pope. His successor Nicholas V, on the other hand, did have kingsize nose, but when he came to power Van Eyck was already dead. If the size of the nose means anything here it's probably just *power*. 

A pope coinciding *partly* with the devil (his face) is consistent with what we've seen in the chandelier, where the Church/pope are almost equal to Lucifer. The difference is different, though. What keeps the 'signature pope' apart from being the devil are the triplets and the G-bird. Unless the breast is not counted as the pope's staff. This is not trivial, because it can mean the difference between a double and a single portrait.

{% include image.html

            class="image-center"
            caption="Another double portrait?" %} 

The thing is, as you can see in the images, that in the inverted devil the triplets appear to form a turban. Topped by – how apt – a feather in the form of the G-bird. Now, if the breast belongs to the pope and represents his staff, then we get the situation in the right-hand image. In that case we have a single portrait of the pope with a turban on his staff. Then you might say that he is just a turban away from being equal to the devil. If, on the other hand, the breast does not belong to the pope and should be coloured red, then it could be an eye beneath the turban. And then we have two heads in one devil. The pope's and... the sultan's? The Ottoman Empire was such a plague to Christian Europe that its head was seen as the Antichrist. And so was the pope in anti-Catholic circles. 

Although I've been busy arguing the eye form being an eye, in this inverted view I think the breast is the sultan's eye rather than the pope's staff. Not in the least because of the way the lifeline runs through the devilish duo. The papal tiara reaches just above it, while the breast/eye/staff dips just below it. The lifeline now seems like a parody of the line dividing heaven and earth; the line that supposedly can only be crossed by the pope, as is shown symbolically by the tiara top sticking into heaven. Here, however, that top crosses into the sultan's zone. This can't be heaven. 

So now the question is: is the devil the sum of the pope and the sultan? That would make the sultan about as evil as the pope. This wouldn't fit with the idea that the sultan is equal to the Antichrist. If the Antichrist, Lucifer, Satan and the devil are just different names of one Tentator (as IMO is suggested in this painting), then the sultan cannot be just part of the devil, represented here by the goat's head in the signature fork. So if Van Eyck went along with the identification of the sultan with the Antichrist, then it's more likely that the double portrait is also a larger single portrait of the sultan. In that case the sultan would be equal to the inverted devil, and the pope would coincide partly with both the sultan and the devil.

            caption="Sultan and sultan" %}   

It's not difficult to stretch the sultan's portrait over the entire inverted devil's form. The 'honeycomb' below the eye, including the pope's eye and ear, can pass for a beard. The horn can represent the sultan's *corpus*, the rest of his body. It's as though it is symbolized by the man's spine, with the smaller C in the end as the coccygeal vertebrae. The horn below the bearded head also suggests that the anti-Christian sultan is the satanic snake of Eden disguised as the sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The snake manifesting itself as sultan fits nicely with the snaky triplets formning his turban. Being a stylized nest of vipers the turban becomes a symbol of anti-Christianity. 

The three G's – the large one in the 'spine', the breast/eye G in the middle, and the feathery bird G in top – support the assertion that Van Eyck considers the evil opposite of God as a trinity as well. An unholy one, of course. And here the aspects of the trinity appear to be substantial rather than personal. The large, fatherly G (with *il Papa*) is connected to the body. Van Eyck may have given it that 'nipple of light' in order to increase the likeness with the breast/eye G, and to make ot easier to consider that G as the filial G of the trio. The one that, because of the eye, is connected to the soul. Whereas the G-bird is the 'unholy' ghost of this anti-Christian G trinity, the G connected to the mind, *Logos*, reason, etcetera. 

What this says, I think, is that it's all relative. Evil is trinitarian, too, but at a lower, more animal level. Its highest spiritual instance, the G-bird, is mere soul – *anima*. While the soul, represented by the eye G, has become flesh – a breast. And the body appears to be flesh hardened into bone: the large spinal G. In short, evil is much more material than good. To be good means to be less material and more spiritual. Moving closer to God means adding soft flesh to the hard bones, adding soul to turn the breast into an eye, and adding *Logos* to turn the weak, black G-bird into a ghost bird strong enough to rule body and soul. The adding of soft flesh doesn't seem very spiritual. On the contrary, it may seem like urging an ascetic to eat more and become fat. But, as the breast shows, flesh is relatively spiritual with regard to the bony body. So adding flesh to it should be seen as adding more spirit to the body, to make it easier for the mind to control it.

Perhaps it was the feather in a sultan's turban that inspired Van Eyck to paint this setup in his signature. Seeing it as a symbol of a Holy Ghost that has become unholy and powerless. Unable to dominate the little snakes that form the turban, and certainly unable to dominate the satanic snake wearing it. I wonder if this view of the turban also applies to Van Eyck's *Portrait of a Man in a Turban* (1433), assumed to be a self-portrait.   

But first some final thoughts about this prong of the signature fork. The reversability of the goat-devil/snake-sultan image explains why especially the lower part of the devil was less convincing as a portrait. Why there was doubt about whether the G-bird formed his mouth or his chin, and why the triplets form such an odd snout. Making the devil look more like a goat, or like a Luciferian bat for that matter, would have made the sultan's portrait less recognizable.

So, in concordance with the situation in the chandelier, we have a pope who is part sultan/devil. He is a sultan without a turban. The turban can be seen as the extension of his tiara that would make the pope equal to the sultan, and so the Antichrist/devil/etc. In other words, the more the pope adds to his temporal power the more sultan-like he becomes. In the pope's portrait I've coloured the sultan's eye golden, to suggest that it can still act as his staff – probing into foreign teritory as an extension of the tiara. Perhaps it also acts as the orb (without the cross) on top of the tiara. 

For the pope to fit into the 3G scheme his XL nose can't actually represent his nose. It's too fleshy. His nose has to be his spine. Or at least something as bony as that. This means that we're looking at his right profile, that is in line with that of the sultan, and that his 'd eye' is not his left eye but his right eye. No doubt the big nose portrait was no accicent, and also intended. If only to make it more clear that there is a portrait within the sultan's portrait. This is helpful, because the 'actual', 3G-obeying portrait is even more elliptical than the big nose portrait. The coccygeal vertebrae hint at a mouth, and the blue arrow in the right-hand image above points at small but clear black line that might indicate the tip of the nose. And the pope appears to be looking straight at it.

This no crack or some spattered paint; this small detail was deliberately put in by the artist. It looks like an I bent into an L with wide open sides. The dot of the I is suggested by the increased blackness in the lower (or left) end. This extra black dot also suggests an L-shaped tadpole. 

Does the L stand for *Lucifer*?

I don't think so...

When we tilt the painting back to its original position, we see the big nose changing into a big fish. Enormous compared to the tiny tadpole swimming along with it. Like the tadpole it has a head that's comparatively big in relation to the rest of its body. Where that body ends is not entirely clear. The breast/eye would make a nice tail fin. But if the whale-like fish is what I think he is, he ought to cover the whole sultan/devil portrait. Adding another portrait along the way... The G-bird would then act as tail fin. The 'honeycomb' and the triplets look more like the waves caused by the whale than parts of his anatomy. His eye is, of course, that light patch that first suggested the nipple of the larger, 'fatherly' breast. A bit of craquelure above the eye gives it an eyebrow and a rather worrisome look.

Any relation between the L/tadpole and the big fish? There sure is. As an L it more or less acts as a caption, pointing out that the name of the big fish starts with an L. More importantly, in the nearby coccygeal vertebrae, doubling as a pectoral fin, Van Eyck indicates that L/tadpoles are the building blocks of the big fish.

            caption="Two tadpolish L's in pectoral fin" %}   

What looks like a small C appears on closer view to be partly made of two even smaller L's. The last one in the spinal line is very vague – suggesting that the 'tail' must end there because the darkness has become too weak. The fact that the final point (indicated by the white arrow) is less vague makes it obvious that this almost wiped out L was like its neighbor, and like the loose L/tadpole observed by the pope. An L with a blacker head. All these little tadpoles, all these little evils, together form a massive evil, the greatest aberration of all creation: the biblical monster of the sea known as the Leviathan.

In the bible the Leviathan is also thought to be a long, crooked serpent. Isaiah predicts its painful end:

>In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. <br><span style="float: right; font-size: smaller;">Isa. 27:1</span> <br>

The Leviathan in the signature has a head that is crooked like the hook of a shepherd's or bishop's staff. (There's that 'father-son' connection with the staff hookish breast/eye again.) Van Eyck has managed to present his Leviathan in both forms in which it was supposed to manifest itself: as a monstrously big fish (a whale), *and* as a serpent. As far as the serpent is concerned I could just refer to the sultan being a manifestation of the satanic snake. But I also like to point to the double L in the coccygeal area again. If you look carefullly, you'll see that that the blacker L on the right is held by its tail by what looks like a snake's head. (Indicated by the yellow arrow.) In turn, the right L holds the vague left L by its vague tail. The blue arrow points at the black 'knot' that marks the point where the larger snake is held by the tail (by another snake). This seems like a good place, because the snake above the two small coccygeal L's then has the right length to be an L itself. Or rather, to have been one. The angle is rounded and its heel, indicated by the orange arrow, has become something like a hinge. 

The inference is clear: this Leviathan is a monster made out of chain of snakes. A serpent of serpents. A long chain of sins, if you consider the basic tadpole as a peccadillo – a small unit of evil. Contemplated by the pope... Van Eyck didn't have to plce the little L/tadpole directly in front of the eyes, if he just wanted suggest the tip of the pope's nose with it. I think he also wanted this ironic juxtaposition of the *leviathanic* pope and this miniature Leviathan. It makes you think about the pope's ability to judge the sins of his flock. And about the need to keep your sins as small as tadpoles, and prevent chain reactions that turn them into serpents. 

Why did Van Eyck incorporate the Leviathan into this devilish part of his signature? Just because he could? I haven't seen any clear reference to the sea monster in the chandelier. Perhaps he wanted to stress the animal character of the Tentator in this part of the fork. And at the same time link the pope/Church to the Leviathan and Isaiah's profecy. The Church, turned into an aberration like the Leviathan, shall be slain. The ecclesiastical serpent shall be chopped into bits. Into *almost* harmless little tadpoles... 

The calligraphy above the J now shows meaningful forms covering the whole of it. In the regular view, if you keep your hands off the painting, we can see the Leviathan. Tilting it 90 degrees to the right, we get the goat-devil. Tilting it 90 degrees to the left, there is the snake-sultan/Antichrist with the pope in it. So, what do we see from the fourth side, when we turn the image 180 degrees?

Not much, to be honest. The triplets give it something a lion's snout. The whole looks like some long-tailed prehistoric flying beast. It could be the Ziz, the Leviathan of the air, but I doubt it. The Behemoth? Nah... More likely is that a fourth meaningful form was simply too much to ask, even of a genius like Jan van Eyck.  

There's a more urgent matter to discuss. All this talk about sultans and popes hiding in this prong seems at odds with my earlier assertion that the signature fork represents an inner conflict. On the other hand, I think I mentioned that when the devil in the prong was already detected. So if the Jan is dealing with the devil inside him, why can't the other forms inside that devil be part of Jan as well? Why can't he also have an inner pope, an inner sultan and an inner Leviathan? If not, if the prong is foreign to Jan, why have a distinction between it and the chandelier, which clearly represents external evil. All in all, I still believe that the evil prong is part of *Johannes de eyck* himself. If he refers to Isaiah 27:1, then it concerns the slaying of the dragon inside him. 

Or *on* his head? Does the turban in *Portrait of a Man in a Turban* represent that beast?

Note that there's no mention of a turban in the National Gallery's official title of the painting. The reason being that the thing on the man's head is actually a chaperon. It is telling that this medieval European headwear has been transformed to look like a turban, the headwear usually worn in the Orient, usually by people who don't care much for Christianity. Even without knowing the sultan in Van Eyck's inscription one might interpret this transformation as a sign that the man is captured in a less than Christian phase. This is not the place to go into this painting too deeply. I just want to point out some things that support the connection with the calligraphic turban, made from a serpentine trinity and a little bird. A precursor of the G-bird may be the owner of the beakish folds in the top of the 'turberon'.

            caption="Beak in top turbanized chaperon?" %}   

The little yellow arrow points to the possible beak, while the white arrowette indicates what appears to be an elongated pupil of an eye close to the alleged beak. It's not a very happy eye, I think. The elongation of the pupil may reflect outside pressure on the eye. Presumably from the darkness surrounding it. Its triangular form suggests the opposite of the All-Seeing Eye of God, which is enclosed in a triangle that radiates glorious light. So what we see above the folded beak is more like the Blind Eye of God – or Satan. The blackened eye in the triangle is reminiscent of the G-bird, the Holy Ghost reduced to a little blackbird of mere soul.  

To its left, indicated by the blue arrow, is a larger dark form. With its red roof it makes one think of caves, tents and sininister monks. I thought I saw a bearded head in there, but I also saw more than two possible eyes, so I suppose that this is also a place of light that went out, a *topos* of degraded *Logos*. The two dark patches seem to be the 'whites' of a larger, equally blind eye. The 'beam' between them, indicated by the green arrow, is its vertical pupil. This beamish pupil is like the elongated pupil in the smaller bird's eye – only much worse. It suggests that the elongated pupil is a pupil halfway between a 'normal' pupil and the vertical one that is often assiciated with evil beings. And of course the suggestion that this large vertical is like a beam supporting a tent hints at the famous parable of the mote and the beam. Jesus said: "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" (Matt. 7:3) 

Considering the beam in the top of the red chaperon, I'd say that it supports a larger bird's head, indicated by the orange arrow in the next image. A head that includes the poor little bird with the folded beak and the squeezed pupil. With the larger head comes a large body, so it seems...

            caption="Big bird on a red nest" %}   

A decidedly wing-like form runs between the big bird's head and the piece of cloth that sticks out on the left. This piece, indicated by the blue arrow, could be the big bird's tail. Although there's so much darkness between it and the main body of the headwear that it appears to be practically separated from it. My impression is that of a red hand fashioning the red cloth. But that doesn't mean that it can't function as a tail as well. 

The white and yellow arrows point to two eyelike forms in the center of the 'nest' below the bird. The one on the right, above the yellow arrow, is pierced by a 'beamette'. This may be the pointy end of the bird's alula, his 'thumb'. The cloth above these eyes and below the wing may also be part of the turban bird's body, by the way. The eyes are directed towards the bird's head, in a manner that reminds me of J looking at the glory of the word made breast. Does the owner of these eyes also want to be nursed? The blinding of the eye by the beamette/thumb suggests that the turban bird lacks motherly feelings. And it confirms my suspicion that we see about the opposite of what we should see on the man's head. (I almost wrote *in* the man's head, since it's quite likely that the turban reflects the man's inner turmoil.) What we should see is a bird that represents a *Logos* strong enough to dominate and enlighten the rest of the individual. A 'logical' bird, a bird that is close to the bird that represents the Holy Ghost, would direct the body and the soul in a good and just way. Blinding eyes is not good. It shows disregard for the soul that can only be expected from its opposite: the body. The bird ruling the mind's nest is a *material* bird. It promotes the cause of the body and is the enemy of the soul, and especially its highest section. 

I think that the small bird, 'annexed' by the big, bad bird, is the equivalent of the little G-bird and represents what is left of Reason. It was darkened and forced te beome part of a bird of Unreason. This bird may be the equivalent of the 'maybe Ziz?' visible in the fourth, 180 degrees view of the evil prong. Since the 0 degrees view shows the Leviathan his winged flipside can't be just another evil bird, like a harpy. The only Leviathan of the sky I can think of is the Ziz. The Simurgh is huge too, but from another tradition, and also said to be an enemy of snakes. Unlike, I think, this devilish bird.

On closer inspection it appears to have *incorporated* a second bird. Although it looks more like a worm with a basic bird's head.

            caption="Third bird?" %}     

This relatively light 'wormbird' occupies the edge of the cloth that forms the top of the big bird's head. Only the lower edge or the one above it as well, I'm not sure. Both edges cross each other below the grey arrow, suggesting a pair of legs. The folded beak of the black-eyed bird may double as the body or a right wing of the wormbird, or just suggest them. Again I'm not sure. If they do dorm part of the wormbird the legs can hardly be all the way near the grey arrow. 

Most convincing, though basic, is the bird's head. It's in the white circle and indicated by the yellow arrow in the close-up. In the centre of the head a clear, 'man-painted' can be seen. A short, straight beak connects with the red of the 'nest' below. If the wormbird is analogous to the Arnolfini G-bird, than this could mean that the nest is made out of three snakes. *Is* the wormbird actually the equivalent of the G-bird and not, as I supposed earlier, the folded beak bird with the black eye and the triangular head? I think so. And I don't think his main business is pecking at the red below; I think it wants to divide the darkness around its beak.    

{% include image.html

            caption="Pecking at darkness?" %} 

That darkness looks like a black hand with three very long, sticky fingers. Fingers like straight burned matches (called *lucifers* in Dutch, by the way). The 'finger' on the left, indicated by the blue arrow, continues beyond the above detail, so it's really to long for a finger. And when you look closely at the bottom of the middle 'finger', you'll see an eye – indicated by the pink arrow – in a black head similar in size and for to that of the wormbird. The big difference is that wormbird's beak is in one piece, and *matchbird*'s beak is not. Because it is divided by wormbird's beak. 

An interesting feature of that beak-battling beak is that it is a bit darker in the lower half. This suggests that this battle of the little long thin birds is still undecided. For, if that lower beak darkens, it would mean that the black beak heals and the red beak shortens to half its original size. On the other hand, if the matchbird is beaten, that would be good news for the larger folded beak bird. That's what I think, because that beak appears to be controlled by the sticky black hand. And if the middle finger is out of commission that would mean more freedom for that beak to resist the remaining darkness. That way the seemingly insignificant battle may get a snowball rolling for the forces of (relative) light.

This can explain the presence of a sinister spectator. His head is hidden behind the two light edges as though it's behind bars. The green arrow points to its evil eye. The grey-brownish head is part of a more or less triangular darkness remniscent of the 'not-seeing eye' above the folded beak. The triangular, shadowy form coupled with the head behind bars gives the evil spectator the appearance of a bat. The sticky fingers add to that impression by reminding this viewer of the long, thin and dark fingers in a bat wing. Two long, pointy bat ears are suggested by the shadows above the evil eye. Their tips are indicated the yellow arrows in the next detail.
