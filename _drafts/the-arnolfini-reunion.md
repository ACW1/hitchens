One of the main reasons for creating this new website/blog is my annoyance at writing threads on Twitter. No doubt there's really handy way at doing it without wasting much time cramming everything into the limited available spaces. I don't know it. My way was to waste a lot of time building this 'venue' for the longer pieces that needs to get out of my brain into an indifferent world. Indifferent it will surely be, but that's okay. The urge to collect my thoughts on the subjects that will be dealt with here is stronger than the need for applause. I might have called called this place *Center for Intrinsically Motivated Texts*, for that matter. But I preferred *Tuur* (pronounced like the German *Tür* – or the Old Norse theonym *Týr*). Strange as it may sound to the English ear, Tuur is a hypocorism of my first name, Arthur. *Tuur* is also the first-person present-tense of the verb *turen* – 'to peer, stare, gaze, pry'. *Nomen est omen*, because that's what I do: I *tuur* at works of art.

My latest target has been *Reunion* by Andrea Kowch. I wasn't aware of its existence, or of the artist, until I came across this tweet from Journal of Art in Society: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s evening in the countryside ~ a young woman muses quietly as she sits modestly in the train, pet dog at her side. She holds a ribboned gift; maybe it’s for a meeting with the person in the car which we can see through the large window (Andrea Kowch, ‘Reunion’) <a href="https://t.co/Vur996v3ef">pic.twitter.com/Vur996v3ef</a></p>&mdash; Journal of Art in Society (@artinsociety) <a href="https://twitter.com/artinsociety/status/1561956706217000960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I thought this was a painting from the 1920s or '30s, until I found out that Kowch was born in 1986 and made it in 2018... 

Why was the painting set almost a century in the past? What is the woman thinking about? What about that gift? What about that car? This work raises many questions. And many answers as well. After joining the speculation party below the tweet, I felt the need to unpack my fragmentary and cramped little contributions into something more solid and roomy.

What made me think of Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434)? Perhaps it was the woman's pale complexion and her uncommon headdress. In my view that combination gives the head a late medieval look. Another duo points particularly to the Van Eyck painting: the dog, emblem of fidelity and love, and the 'mirror' straight above it.
