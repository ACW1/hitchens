One of the main reasons for creating this new website/blog is my annoyance at writing threads on Twitter. No doubt there's really handy way at doing it without wasting much time cramming everything into the limited available spaces. I don't know it. My way was to waste a lot of time building this 'venue' for the longer pieces that needs to get out of my brain into an indifferent world. Indifferent it will surely be, but that's okay. The urge to collect my thoughts on the subjects that will be dealt with here is stronger than the need for applause. I might have called called this place *Center for Intrinsically Motivated Texts*, for that matter. But I preferred *Tuur* (pronounced like the German *Tür* – or the Old Norse theonym *Týr*). Strange as it may sound to the English ear, Tuur is a hypocorism of my first name, Arthur. *Tuur* is also the first-person present-tense of the verb *turen* – 'to peer, stare, gaze, pry'. *Nomen est omen*, because that's what I do: I *tuur* at works of art.

My latest target has been *Reunion* by Andrea Kowch. I wasn't aware of its existence, or of the artist, until I came across this tweet from Journal of Art in Society: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s evening in the countryside ~ a young woman muses quietly as she sits modestly in the train, pet dog at her side. She holds a ribboned gift; maybe it’s for a meeting with the person in the car which we can see through the large window (Andrea Kowch, ‘Reunion’) <a href="https://t.co/Vur996v3ef">pic.twitter.com/Vur996v3ef</a></p>&mdash; Journal of Art in Society (@artinsociety) <a href="https://twitter.com/artinsociety/status/1561956706217000960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I thought this was a painting from the 1920s or '30s, until I found out that Kowch was born in 1986 and made it in 2018... 

Why was the painting set almost a century in the past? What is the woman thinking about? What about that gift? What about that car? This work raises many questions. And many answers as well. After joining the speculation party below the tweet, I felt the need to unpack my fragmentary and cramped little contributions into something more solid and roomy.

What made me think of Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434)? Perhaps it was the woman's pale complexion and her uncommon headdress. In my view that combination gives the head a late medieval look. Another duo points particularly to the Van Eyck painting: the dog, emblem of fidelity and love, and the 'mirror' straight above it.

I would have been less convinced of the double reference if the 'mirror' in the train hadn't been positioned straight above the dog. It's like a hand mirror attached to a wall, but since mirrors don't have switches, it is probably a – mirror-like – lamp. Since it doesn't appear to be switched on, the lamp is both an equivalent and an opposite of the Arnolfini mirror. That mirror is like an all-seeing eye, while the lamp is like an eye that is clouded over, as though it is suffering from a cataract. While the upturned switch stresses the lack of light, the 'teeth' of the 'cogwheel' around the mirror stress the surplus of light. First, because they suggest the stylized rays of a stylized sun. Second, because those 'teeth' are filled with images of the Passion of Jesus, a.k.a. Light of the World.

            caption="The mirror and its equivalent" %}

The gear-like shape of the mirror also reminds one of watches, and of God as the Divine Watchmaker. (Gears where already used in clocks in Van Eyck's time, so it's not impossible that the watchmaker analogy already formulated in the fifteenth century.) But, if God the Son is in the 'teeth' of the mirror and God the Father is all-seeing eye in the center, then where is God the Holy Ghost? Is it the red ring with the blue rectangles that connects the two? Other options lie outside the mirror: the pearly thing with the green tassels hanging on a nail to the left of the mirror. Or the chandelier above the mirror. Neither is a very convincing Holy Ghost. Simply because they're not one with the Father and Son in the mirror. And while a chandelier in itself might well be a symbol of the Holy Ghost, this particular one is less suitable because there's only one candle burning in it. 

Why is that? And why do I think that the chandelier shows a lack of light, while it's broad daylight and there's no need for candlelight at all? It's actually a surplus of light. The one burning candle may refer to the eternal flame of a santuary lamp in churches in synagogues. But as far as I know these hold only one burning candle and not several extinguished candles next to it. Some think that the burning candle means that the man, Giovanni Arnolfini, was still alive when he was painted, while his wife was already dead. This only makes sense if the wife was not Giovanna Cenami but the more probable candidate, Constanza Trenta, who died in 1433. But why use a six-armed chandelier for this? Did Arnolfini have four other dead wives? The association of the candle burning in full daylight with the sanctuary lamp suggests that Giovanni's flame (i.e. life) is eternal while Constanza's life has ended completely with her earthly existence. Was she denied an afterlife in heaven? If so, why would the husband have commissioned such a loving portrait? Surely, Van Eyck could have come up with a better, less confusing way of showing that Giovanni was the surviving half of the pair. *If* he wanted to... For instance, the aforementionted pearly thing with the green tassels may not represent the Holy Ghost, but it may indicate that the husband is still among the living. It forms an unequal pair with the sweep or brush hanging on the wife's side of the mirror. It's like a single, large and 'dead' version of the 'living' green tassels. On the other hand, the dead woman's dress is the same kind of green... Adding to the confusion is the coloring of the brush's handle. Red and blue, like the 'ring' in the mirror that might represent the Holy Ghost.

So, what would it mean if that handle is a reflection of the Holy Ghost? I don't know...           
I'm more confident about the meaning of the chandelier.

            caption="The 'dark' chandelier and candle" %}

I have an idea about the chandelier that I haven't come across elsewhere. One that fits with both the somewhat sad, 'dark' state of the chandelier and the suspicion that the mirror represents the Holy Trinity. The name 'Lucifer' says it all. As you probably know, it means 'light-bringer' or 'light-bearer'. Which is a little odd for someone considered to be the equivalent of the Prince of Darkness and the Antichrist. If such an evil character bears/brings light, there must be something wrong with it. It must be like a will-o'-the-wisp, leading respectable souls astray. Or in another sense not very useful to mankind. Light that is superfluous, like in this case, where braod daylight makes candlelight unnecessary. While at night, that same single, grey candle probably wouldn't bring enough light to be of much help. Most of the light coming from the elaborate and expensive chandelier is reflected daylight. With its six brass arms it appears to rival the mirror/sun with its ten Passion rays. This, too, fits with the chandelier representing Lucifer. The fallen angel is associated with the planet Venus, also known as the morning star. It rises before the sun, bringing some light to the world. But that weak light is soon completely 'overshadowed' by the light of the rising sun. Hold that celestial thought.

First I'd like to strengthen my assertion that the chandelier is Luciferian. Note, for instance, the ends of the six arms. They're crowns. When you turn the chandelier 180 degrees, the six crowns are part of a larger crown-like form. The Dutch word for this object is appropriate: 'kroonluchter', the equivalent of 'crown lighter'. Van Eyck may have used the Middle Dutch word 'luchtere' (attested in the early 15th century), the nomen agentis of the verb 'luchten' – 'to give light'. So in a sense, Lucifer, the bringer/bearer of light, might also be called 'luchter(e)'.

Six crowns in one big crown suggest a double trinity: *sex personae, una substantia*, to paraphrase Tertullian. Or, one king with six aspects. Like the pope's tiara, the multiple crown also says: this is no ordinary king – this is a king of kings. Ironically, the papal tiara has evolved out of a simple Phrygian cap, a headdress shaped like the cone of... a candle extinguisher. The Arnolfini chandelier can be seen as the final stage of the tiara's development – and, by extension, of the papacy. The early popes were like their humble Phrygian caps: extinguishers of Lucifer's false candlelight. But the cap became a crown, the crown became a double crown, and finally a triple crown. (Not to mention the circlets and diadems that went into it.) The more elaborate the former cap became, the more it changed from a candle extinguisher into a chandelier, spreading the false light that it used to extinguish...

When you disregard the arms, you notice that the central 'body' of the chandelier actually does look like a papal tiara. The chandelier is like a papal tiara that has sprouted six branches. Perhaps Van Eyck has seen pictures of popes similar to the relatively crude example from the *Liber chronicorum*. All the popes depicted in that book wear the tiara, even when they didn't, like the early pope Anterus. The protruding parts of the three crowns look like leaves; suggesting that the tiara can grow even further, like a tree. This could make the chandelier a model for the papal tiara of the future. (From Van Eyck's point of view, of course.) If the Church continues in the direction it has taken, at some point the added power and pomp will be reflected in a papal tiara that looks like this chandelier. 

The chandelier may represent the future 'multi-crown' of the pope, but it may also represent the present 'multi-crown' of Lucifer. Another 'king of kings', who, like the pope, is considered powerful enough to depose or install kings. If you identify Lucifer with Satan (no problem at all, as far as I'm concerned), you only have to think about the Temptation of Christ. Satan takes Jesus to the top of 'a very high mountain', "and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me." (Matt. 4:8-9) 

In my opinion it's not an either/or proposition; I think that the chandelier represents both a present and a future crown. The idea being that the pope's increasing power means that he will become increasingly like the Satan/Lucifer on the very high mountain. If this was also Van Eyck's idea, it is like a much more subtle and better-drawn ancestor of the Protestant depictions of the pope as the Antichrist. 

The more familiar 'cherry' on top of the papal tiara is the *globus cruciger*, symbolizing Christ's dominion over the orb of the world. However, the tiara topped with just a sphere is also common. It can be seen, for instance, in the commemorative coin of Eugenius IV, the ruling pope when Van Eyck painted *The Arnolfini Portrait*.

In images like this it's not unusual to see the tiara sticking into something above a certain border. No doubt the border between heaven and earth. Ergo: you need a tiara, you have to be the Vicar of Christ, to be able to establish this heavenly connection. Oddly, pope Anterus's little tiara orb has crossed the border of his halo, suggesting that it has gone beyond the heavenly sphere. It looks like a ring, which is exactly what our chandelier tiara has in place of an orb. This may have a special significance here, but it doesn't have to. Although I don't quite see the function of this ring, it is not uncommon in chandeliers. I do understand the need for a ring at the top, to hang the chandelier on the ceiling. Sometimes you see rings at the top and at the bottom, like in Meckenem's copper engraving *The Lute Player and the Harpist*. This chandelier also hangs above a seemingly harmonious pair: a woman playing the harp, and a man (with **very** pointy shoes) playing the lute.

  The rings on both ends suggest that the chandelier can also be hung upside down. Although it doesn't seem very practical. Like the Arnolfini chandelier the Meckenem chandelier has crown-like forms underneath the candles, and in the middle a fifth crown that isn't upside down. There's an eye to the left of the base of the longest of the four candles. This (all-)seeing eye appears to be opposed by an eye that is not seeing, because it is obstructed by the left leg of the M shape beneath the fifth crown. On top of that M, directly below that crown I see a smaller pair of eyes. My guess is that they reflect the respective strengths of the evil, unseeing eye to the left and the good, all-seeing eye to the right. The harmony of the music/marriage below may be linked to the dominant force in the 'fifth' king. 

  Meckenem may have combined in the chandelier what Van Eyck divided over the chandelier and the mirror. The Arnolfini chandelier is not hanging on a ring. The best available reproduction has cut off a bit from the top of the painting, so I had to resort to a lesser but more complete reproduction to show how the chandelier is attached. And since it's pretty dark up there, I have lightened the details.

            caption="The T on top of the chandelier" %} 

So apparently the thing is suspended on two mouse grey knots at the end of two threads. The knots are like two fluffy eyeballs beneath a long monobrow formed by a straight, dragonesque snake. Head on the left, tail on the right. Although that tail could also be a head – a snake's head. As a double-sided animal it seems to be made be two adjoining gargoyles on top of a church spire. Not quite the right location for gargoyles. Just like the chandelier itself is not quite like the then-present papal tiara... Together, 'gargoyles' and 'spire' form a big letter T. Or, two L's of *Lucifer* with a shared stem? Mweh... Even so, that doesn't make the more obvious T go away. What might that T stand for? If the chandelier is indeed evil, then the T could stand something that could destroy the Arnolfini marriage: *Temptation*.

In Middle Dutch the word was also spelled with a t – 'temptacie'. And in Latin it is, of course, *tentatio*. Given the fact that the inscription between the chandelier and the mirror is in Latin, this could be the main language used in the painting. Why would the T stand for *Tentatio* rather than, say, *Tenebris* ('darkness')? *Tenebris* is apt well, given the relatieve darkness in the area above the chandelier. A darkness that, strangely, is hardly broken by the light of the one burning candle. So, it could be *Tenebris* as well, but not just *Tenebris*, IMO. We've already seen a hint of the third temptation of Christ (according to Matthew). The many crowns in the chandelier that, via the pope's deposing and crowning power, can refer to the kingdoms that Satan/Lucifer gives away for worship. In the church spire that forms the stem of the T I see a reference to the second temptation of Christ (again following Matthew's order of events). "Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." (Matt. 4:5-6)

In the Statenvertaling (1637), the Dutch equivalent of the King James bible, 'a pinncle of the temple' is translated with 'de tinne des tempels'. Two more T words... 'Tinne' is a Middle Dutch word meaning 'battlement, crenelation'. And that's exactly what can be seen around the base of the spire.

            caption="The battlements of the temple" %} 

If the chandelier refers to two out of three temptations of Christ, one might expect a reference to the third one as well. The first one, according to Matthew, came when Jesus was hungry after fasting forty days and nights in the wilderness. "And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
" (Matt. 4:3-4) I don't see any stones in the chandelier, but you might say that its branches and thorny protrusions are like a wilderness. In fact, the chandelier can be neatly divided into the settings of the three temptation attempts.

            class="image-center"
            caption="The chandelier of Temptation" %}   

The wilderness of Temptation 1 flanks the blue mountain of Temptation 3, turned upside down beneath the golden temple tower of Temptation 2. That tower is higher than the 'very high' mountain, unless you subtract the red Temptation T from the temple. Then the tower is as high as the mountain (cum tiara in the chandelier body) minus the red head with the ring at the bottom. This suggests a link between that fiery head and the T. [inscriptie verwijst naar 'every word that proceeded etc.'?]
