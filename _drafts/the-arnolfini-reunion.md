One of the main reasons for creating this new website/blog is my annoyance at writing threads on Twitter. No doubt there's really handy way at doing it without wasting much time cramming everything into the limited available spaces. I don't know it. My way was to waste a lot of time building this 'venue' for the longer pieces that needs to get out of my brain into an indifferent world. Indifferent it will surely be, but that's okay. The urge to collect my thoughts on the subjects that will be dealt with here is stronger than the need for applause. I might have called called this place *Center for Intrinsically Motivated Texts*, for that matter. But I preferred *Tuur* (pronounced like the German *Tür* – or the Old Norse theonym *Týr*). Strange as it may sound to the English ear, Tuur is a hypocorism of my first name, Arthur. *Tuur* is also the first-person present-tense of the verb *turen* – 'to peer, stare, gaze, pry'. *Nomen est omen*, because that's what I do: I *tuur* at works of art.

My latest target has been *Reunion* by Andrea Kowch. I wasn't aware of its existence, or of the artist, until I came across this tweet from Journal of Art in Society: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s evening in the countryside ~ a young woman muses quietly as she sits modestly in the train, pet dog at her side. She holds a ribboned gift; maybe it’s for a meeting with the person in the car which we can see through the large window (Andrea Kowch, ‘Reunion’) <a href="https://t.co/Vur996v3ef">pic.twitter.com/Vur996v3ef</a></p>&mdash; Journal of Art in Society (@artinsociety) <a href="https://twitter.com/artinsociety/status/1561956706217000960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I thought this was a painting from the 1920s or '30s, until I found out that Kowch was born in 1986 and made it in 2018... 

Why was the painting set almost a century in the past? What is the woman thinking about? What about that gift? What about that car? This work raises many questions. And many answers as well. After joining the speculation party below the tweet, I felt the need to unpack my fragmentary and cramped little contributions into something more solid and roomy.

What made me think of Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434)? Perhaps it was the woman's pale complexion and her uncommon headdress. In my view that combination gives the head a late medieval look. Another duo points particularly to the Van Eyck painting: the dog, emblem of fidelity and love, and the 'mirror' straight above it.

I would have been less convinced of the double reference if the 'mirror' in the train hadn't been positioned straight above the dog. It's like a hand mirror attached to a wall, but since mirrors don't have switches, it is probably a – mirror-like – lamp. Since it doesn't appear to be switched on, the lamp is both an equivalent and an opposite of the Arnolfini mirror. That mirror is like an all-seeing eye, while the lamp is like an eye that is clouded over, as though it is suffering from a cataract. While the upturned switch stresses the lack of light, the 'teeth' of the 'cogwheel' around the mirror stress the surplus of light. First, because they suggest the stylized rays of a stylized sun. Second, because those 'teeth' are filled with images of the Passion of Jesus, a.k.a. Light of the World.

The gear-like shape of the mirror also reminds one of watches, and of God as the Divine Watchmaker. (Gears where already used in clocks in Van Eyck's time, so it's not impossible that the watchmaker analogy already formulated in the fifteenth century.) But, if God the Son is in the 'teeth' of the mirror and God the Father is all-seeing eye in the center, then where is God the Holy Ghost? Is it the red ring with the blue rectangles that connects the two? Other options lie outside the mirror: the pearly thing with the green tassels hanging on a nail to the left of the mirror. Or the chandelier above the mirror. Neither is a very convincing Holy Ghost. Simply because they're not one with the Father and Son in the mirror. And while a chandelier in itself might well be a symbol of the Holy Ghost, this particular one is less suitable because there's only one candle burning in it. 

Why is that? And why do I think that the chandelier shows a lack of light, while it's broad daylight and there's no need for candlelight at all? It's actually a surplus of light. The one burning candle may refer to the eternal flame of a santuary lamp in churches in synagogues. But as far as I know these hold only one burning candle and not several extinguished candles next to it. Some think that the burning candle means that the man, Giovanni Arnolfini, was still alive when he was painted, while his wife was already dead. This only makes sense if the wife was not Giovanna Cenami but the more probable candidate, Constanza Trenta, who died in 1433. But why use a six-armed chandelier for this? Did Arnolfini have four other dead wives? The association of the candle burning in full daylight with the sanctuary lamp suggests that Giovanni's flame (i.e. life) is eternal while Constanza's life has ended completely with her earthly existence. Was she denied an afterlife in heaven? If so, why would the husband have commissioned such a loving portrait? Surely, Van Eyck could have come up with a better, less confusing way of showing that Giovanni was the surviving half of the pair. *If* he wanted to...

I have another idea about this chandelier. One I haven't come across elsewhere, and one that fits with both the suspicion that the mirror represents the Holy Trinity and the somewhat sad, 'dark' state of the chandelier. The name 'Lucifer' says it all – meaning, as you probably know, 'light-bringer' or 'light-bearer'. Which is a little odd for someone considered to be the equivalent of the Prince of Darkness and the Antichrist. If such an evil character bears/brings light it can only be like a will-o'-the-wisp, leading respectable souls astray, or useless light. Light that is either too much or too little. Here, in broad daylight, it is too much, it isn't necessary. At night, the single candle would bring light, but not enough to be of much use. [fallen angel]
