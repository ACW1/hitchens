One of the main reasons for creating this new website/blog is my annoyance at writing threads on Twitter. No doubt there's really handy way at doing it without wasting much time cramming everything into the limited available spaces. I don't know it. My way was to waste a lot of time building this 'venue' for the longer pieces that needs to get out of my brain into an indifferent world. Indifferent it will surely be, but that's okay. The urge to collect my thoughts on the subjects that will be dealt with here is stronger than the need for applause. I might have called called this place *Center for Intrinsically Motivated Texts*, for that matter. But I preferred *Tuur* (pronounced like the German *Tür* – or the Old Norse theonym *Týr*). Strange as it may sound to the English ear, Tuur is a hypocorism of my first name, Arthur. *Tuur* is also the first-person present-tense of the verb *turen* – 'to peer, stare, gaze, pry'. *Nomen est omen*, because that's what I do: I *tuur* at works of art.

My latest target has been *Reunion* by Andrea Kowch. I wasn't aware of its existence, or of the artist, until I came across this tweet from Journal of Art in Society: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s evening in the countryside ~ a young woman muses quietly as she sits modestly in the train, pet dog at her side. She holds a ribboned gift; maybe it’s for a meeting with the person in the car which we can see through the large window (Andrea Kowch, ‘Reunion’) <a href="https://t.co/Vur996v3ef">pic.twitter.com/Vur996v3ef</a></p>&mdash; Journal of Art in Society (@artinsociety) <a href="https://twitter.com/artinsociety/status/1561956706217000960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I thought this was a painting from the 1920s or '30s, until I found out that Kowch was born in 1986 and made it in 2018... 

Why was the painting set almost a century in the past? What is the woman thinking about? What about that gift? What about that car? This work raises many questions. And many answers as well. After joining the speculation party below the tweet, I felt the need to unpack my fragmentary and cramped little contributions into something more solid and roomy.

What made me think of Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434)? Perhaps it was the woman's pale complexion and her uncommon headdress. In my view that combination gives the head a late medieval look. Another duo points particularly to the Van Eyck painting: the dog, emblem of fidelity and love, and the 'mirror' straight above it.

I would have been less convinced of the double reference if the 'mirror' in the train hadn't been positioned straight above the dog. It's like a hand mirror attached to a wall, but since mirrors don't have switches, it is probably a – mirror-like – lamp. Since it doesn't appear to be switched on, the lamp is both an equivalent and an opposite of the Arnolfini mirror. That mirror is like an all-seeing eye, while the lamp is like an eye that is clouded over, as though it is suffering from a cataract. While the upturned switch stresses the lack of light, the 'teeth' of the 'cogwheel' around the mirror stress the surplus of light. First, because they suggest the stylized rays of a stylized sun. Second, because those 'teeth' are filled with images of the Passion of Jesus, a.k.a. Light of the World.

            caption="The mirror and its equivalent" %}

The gear-like shape of the mirror also reminds one of watches, and of God as the Divine Watchmaker. (Gears where already used in clocks in Van Eyck's time, so it's not impossible that the watchmaker analogy already formulated in the fifteenth century.) But, if God the Son is in the 'teeth' of the mirror and God the Father is all-seeing eye in the center, then where is God the Holy Ghost? Is it the red ring with the blue rectangles that connects the two? Other options lie outside the mirror: the pearly thing with the green tassels hanging on a nail to the left of the mirror. Or the chandelier above the mirror. Neither is a very convincing Holy Ghost. Simply because they're not one with the Father and Son in the mirror. And while a chandelier in itself might well be a symbol of the Holy Ghost, this particular one is less suitable because there's only one candle burning in it. 

Why is that? And why do I think that the chandelier shows a lack of light, while it's broad daylight and there's no need for candlelight at all? It's actually a surplus of light. The one burning candle may refer to the eternal flame of a santuary lamp in churches in synagogues. But as far as I know these hold only one burning candle and not several extinguished candles next to it. Some think that the burning candle means that the man, Giovanni Arnolfini, was still alive when he was painted, while his wife was already dead. This only makes sense if the wife was not Giovanna Cenami but the more probable candidate, Constanza Trenta, who died in 1433. But why use a six-armed chandelier for this? Did Arnolfini have four other dead wives? The association of the candle burning in full daylight with the sanctuary lamp suggests that Giovanni's flame (i.e. life) is eternal while Constanza's life has ended completely with her earthly existence. Was she denied an afterlife in heaven? If so, why would the husband have commissioned such a loving portrait? Surely, Van Eyck could have come up with a better, less confusing way of showing that Giovanni was the surviving half of the pair. *If* he wanted to... For instance, the aforementionted pearly thing with the green tassels may not represent the Holy Ghost, but it may indicate that the husband is still among the living. It forms an unequal pair with the sweep or brush hanging on the wife's side of the mirror. It's like a single, large and 'dead' version of the 'living' green tassels. On the other hand, the dead woman's dress is the same kind of green... Adding to the confusion is the coloring of the brush's handle. Red and blue, like the 'ring' in the mirror that might represent the Holy Ghost.

So, what would it mean if that handle is a reflection of the Holy Ghost? I don't know...           
I'm more confident about the meaning of the chandelier.

            caption="The 'dark' chandelier and candle" %}

I have an idea about the chandelier that I haven't come across elsewhere. One that fits with both the somewhat sad, 'dark' state of the chandelier and the suspicion that the mirror represents the Holy Trinity. The name 'Lucifer' says it all. As you probably know, it means 'light-bringer' or 'light-bearer'. Which is a little odd for someone considered to be the equivalent of the Prince of Darkness and the Antichrist. If such an evil character bears/brings light, there must be something wrong with it. It must be like a will-o'-the-wisp, leading respectable souls astray. Or in another sense not very useful to mankind. Light that is superfluous, like in this case, where braod daylight makes candlelight unnecessary. While at night, that same single, grey candle probably wouldn't bring enough light to be of much help. Most of the light coming from the elaborate and expensive chandelier is reflected daylight. With its six brass arms it appears to rival the mirror/sun with its ten Passion rays. This, too, fits with the chandelier representing Lucifer. The fallen angel is associated with the planet Venus, also known as the morning star. It rises before the sun, bringing some light to the world. But that weak light is soon completely 'overshadowed' by the light of the rising sun. Hold that celestial thought.

First I'd like to strengthen my assertion that the chandelier is Luciferian. Note, for instance, the ends of the six arms. They're crowns. When you turn the chandelier 180 degrees, the six crowns are part of a larger crown-like form. The Dutch word for this object is appropriate: 'kroonluchter', the equivalent of 'crown lighter'. Van Eyck may have used the Middle Dutch word 'luchtere' (attested in the early 15th century), the nomen agentis of the verb 'luchten' – 'to give light'. So in a sense, Lucifer, the bringer/bearer of light, might also be called 'luchter(e)'.

Six crowns in one big crown suggest a double trinity: *sex personae, una substantia*, to paraphrase Tertullian. Or, one king with six aspects. Like the pope's tiara, the multiple crown also says: this is no ordinary king – this is a king of kings. Ironically, the papal tiara has evolved out of a simple Phrygian cap, a headdress shaped like the cone of... a candle extinguisher. The Arnolfini chandelier can be seen as the final stage of the tiara's development – and, by extension, of the papacy. The early popes were like their humble Phrygian caps: extinguishers of Lucifer's false candlelight. But the cap became a crown, the crown became a double crown, and finally a triple crown. (Not to mention the circlets and diadems that went into it.) The more elaborate the former cap became, the more it changed from a candle extinguisher into a chandelier, spreading the false light that it used to extinguish...

When you disregard the arms, you notice that the central 'body' of the chandelier actually does look like a papal tiara. The chandelier is like a papal tiara that has sprouted six branches. Perhaps Van Eyck has seen pictures of popes similar to the relatively crude example from the *Liber chronicorum*. All the popes depicted in that book wear the tiara, even when they didn't, like the early pope Anterus. The protruding parts of the three crowns look like leaves; suggesting that the tiara can grow even further, like a tree. This could make the chandelier a model for the papal tiara of the future. (From Van Eyck's point of view, of course.) If the Church continues in the direction it has taken, at some point the added power and pomp will be reflected in a papal tiara that looks like this chandelier. 

The chandelier may represent the future 'multi-crown' of the pope, but it may also represent the present 'multi-crown' of Lucifer. Another 'king of kings', who, like the pope, is considered powerful enough to depose or install kings. If you identify Lucifer with Satan (no problem at all, as far as I'm concerned), you only have to think about the Temptation of Christ. Satan takes Jesus to the top of 'a very high mountain', "and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me." (Matt. 4:8-9) 

In my opinion it's not an either/or proposition; I think that the chandelier represents both a present and a future crown. The idea being that the pope's increasing power means that he will become increasingly like the Satan/Lucifer on the very high mountain. If this was also Van Eyck's idea, it is like a much more subtle and better-drawn ancestor of the Protestant depictions of the pope as the Antichrist. 

The more familiar 'cherry' on top of the papal tiara is the *globus cruciger*, symbolizing Christ's dominion over the orb of the world. However, the tiara topped with just a sphere is also common. It can be seen, for instance, in the commemorative coin of Eugenius IV, the ruling pope when Van Eyck painted *The Arnolfini Portrait*.

In images like this it's not unusual to see the tiara sticking into something above a certain border. No doubt the border between heaven and earth. Ergo: you need a tiara, you have to be the Vicar of Christ, to be able to establish this heavenly connection. Oddly, pope Anterus's little tiara orb has crossed the border of his halo, suggesting that it has gone beyond the heavenly sphere. It looks like a ring, which is exactly what our chandelier tiara has in place of an orb. This may have a special significance here, but it doesn't have to. Although I don't quite see the function of this ring, it is not uncommon in chandeliers. I do understand the need for a ring at the top, to hang the chandelier on the ceiling. Sometimes you see rings at the top and at the bottom, like in Meckenem's copper engraving *The Lute Player and the Harpist*. This chandelier also hangs above a seemingly harmonious pair: a woman playing the harp, and a man (with **very** pointy shoes) playing the lute.

  The rings on both ends suggest that the chandelier can also be hung upside down. Although it doesn't seem very practical. Like the Arnolfini chandelier the Meckenem chandelier has crown-like forms underneath the candles, and in the middle a fifth crown that isn't upside down. There's an eye to the left of the base of the longest of the four candles. This (all-)seeing eye appears to be opposed by an eye that is not seeing, because it is obstructed by the left leg of the M shape beneath the fifth crown. On top of that M, directly below that crown I see a smaller pair of eyes. My guess is that they reflect the respective strengths of the evil, unseeing eye to the left and the good, all-seeing eye to the right. The harmony of the music/marriage below may be linked to the dominant force in the 'fifth' king. 

  Meckenem may have combined in the chandelier what Van Eyck divided over the chandelier and the mirror. The Arnolfini chandelier is not hanging on a ring. The best available reproduction has cut off a bit from the top of the painting, so I had to resort to a lesser but more complete reproduction to show how the chandelier is attached. And since it's pretty dark up there, I have lightened the details.

            caption="The T on top of the chandelier" %} 

So apparently the thing is suspended on two mouse grey knots at the end of two threads. The knots are like two fluffy eyeballs beneath a long monobrow formed by a straight, dragonesque snake. Head on the left, tail on the right. Although that tail could also be a head – a snake's head. As a double-sided animal it seems to be made be two adjoining gargoyles on top of a church spire. Not quite the right location for gargoyles. Just like the chandelier itself is not quite like the then-present papal tiara... Together, 'gargoyles' and 'spire' form a big letter T. Or, two L's of *Lucifer* with a shared stem? Mweh... Even so, that doesn't make the more obvious T go away. What might that T stand for? If the chandelier is indeed evil, then the T could stand something that could destroy the Arnolfini marriage: *Temptation*.

In Middle Dutch the word was also spelled with a t – 'temptacie'. And in Latin it is, of course, *tentatio*. Given the fact that the inscription between the chandelier and the mirror is in Latin, this could be the main language used in the painting. Why would the T stand for *Tentatio* rather than, say, *Tenebris* ('darkness')? *Tenebris* is apt well, given the relatieve darkness in the area above the chandelier. A darkness that, strangely, is hardly broken by the light of the one burning candle. So, it could be *Tenebris* as well, but not just *Tenebris*, IMO. We've already seen a hint of the third temptation of Christ (according to Matthew). The many crowns in the chandelier that, via the pope's deposing and crowning power, can refer to the kingdoms that Satan/Lucifer gives away for worship. In the church spire that forms the stem of the T I see a reference to the second temptation of Christ (again following Matthew's order of events). "Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." (Matt. 4:5-6)

In the Statenvertaling (1637), the Dutch equivalent of the King James bible, 'a pinncle of the temple' is translated with 'de tinne des tempels'. Two more T words... 'Tinne' is a Middle Dutch word meaning 'battlement, crenelation'. And that's exactly what can be seen around the base of the spire.

            caption="The battlements of the temple" %} 

If the chandelier refers to two out of three temptations of Christ, one might expect a reference to the third one as well. The first one, according to Matthew, came when Jesus was hungry after fasting forty days and nights in the wilderness. "And when the **Tempter** came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
" (Matt. 4:3-4) I don't see any stones in the chandelier, but you might say that its branches and thorny protrusions are like a wilderness. In fact, the chandelier can be neatly divided into the settings of the three temptation attempts.

            class="image-center"
            caption="The chandelier of Temptation" %}   

The brown wilderness of T1 flanks the blue mountain of T3, turned upside down beneath the golden temple tower of T2. That tower is higher than the 'very high' mountain, unless you subtract the red Temptation T from the temple. Then the tower is as high as the mountain (cum tiara in the chandelier body) minus the red head with the ring at the bottom. This suggests a link between that fiery head and the T. This link could be that the head is the head of the chandelier beast and the T its tail. The T may also say something about the identity of the head's owner. Given the now obvious references to the scenes of the three temptations of Christ, it is likely that apart from *Temptation* the T can also stand for *Tempter*, as the devil/Satan/Lucifer is named when he first appears before Jesus. The word used in the Early New Dutch of the Statenvertaling is 'verzoeker' (compare German 'Versucher'), but a bible translator in Van Eyck's time may have used the Middle Dutch 'tempterer' or one of its variants, 'tempteerre' and 'tempteerder'. In the Vulgate the tempter is called *tentator*.  

The advantage of *Tentator* is that it's a good umbrella term for all the big baddies: Satan, Lucifer, Antichrist etc. It's certainly useful here because the chandelier integrates the devil/Satan of the temptation with Lucifer the light-bringing morning star. The *Tentator*'s head looks more Luciferian than Satanic: it's like the head of a bat with lion's manes.

            caption="The batlike Morning Star shines" %}   

Some bat grey can be seen in the eyebrows, and the two threads with which 'he' hangs on the ceiling. Lucifer had been described and depicted with battish characteristics long before this painting. It is said that when he fell from heaven his angel's wings turned into bat wings. Dante's described them like this:

>*Beneath each face of his, two wings spread out,
as broad as suited so immense a bird:
I’ve never seen a ship with sails so wide.*

>*They had no feathers, but were fashioned like
a bat’s; and he was agitating them,
so that three winds made their way out from him—* <br><span style="float: right; font-size: smaller;">(Inf. 34.46-51)</span> 
<br>

Since Dante's Lucifer has three faces, he has six wings – the same number of arms/wings like our Lucifer in the chandelier. A few years earlier, Giotto had painted flying demons with batlike wings in one of his scenes in the life of St. Francis. They have just two each, so it's not surprising that Lucifer got more. His six wings, two for each of his three *personae*, suggest that the chandelier opposes the Holy Trinity of the mirror with an unholy trinity. Dante's threefold Lucifer is made of what he considered the greatest traitors in human history: Brutus, Cassius and Judas. Van Eyck's chandelier trinity has different aspects. The theme here isn't treason but temptation. So if 'Tentator' is opposed to God, the three *personae* may be Tentator Satan/devil, Tentator Lucifer, and Tentator Antichrist. This trichotomy is, however, less obvious than the one we've already seen, that of the temptation locations. This may suffice, but I'm curious to see if those persons are present. Lucifer certainly is, with the batlike appearance of the chandelier. And the Antichrist? You might say that the crowns in the chandelier, directed against suffering Christ in the mirror, are the opposite of His crown of thorns. Since the prefix *anti* means 'against', the fact alone that the chandelier is pointed against the Christian mirror is enough to call it anti-Christian. 

And the devil? He may be hiding in the details...

            class="image-center"
            caption="The devil's eye?" %}   

It now seems even more likely that Meckenem's engraving was inspired by the *Arnolfini
Portrait*, as there's an eye hidden in the 'wilderness' on the left of the 'mountain'. This eye, pointed out by the white arrow, may form a pair with the much flatter eye-like shape near the yellow arrow. This possible left eye also seems to be part of a skull in the aperture next to the more realistic eye. That small skull could be part of a long, devilish head, partly coinciding with one of the crowns, behind the brass arms. The red arrow points to one of several cornicular protrusions, while the green arrow points to the tip of the possible goatee. The big eye corresponds with the seeing left eye in the Meckenem chandelier. I hesitate to call it all-seeing and divine now, since it appears that he had lifted this eye from Van Eyck's chandelier – an eye that, given the unholy context, can hardly be all-seeing and divine. As in Meckenem's chandelier there's an unseeing eye opposed to the seeing one. There it is unseeing because it is obstructed, here it is unseeing because it's hollow – the apple of the eye is missing. Like the seeing eye the unseeing one is connected to a crown in the back of the chandelier.

            caption="The seeing and unseeing eye of Van Eyck's chandelier" %}    

I'm afraid that my interpretation of the eyes in the Meckenem chandelier is of much use anymore. And certainly not of use in explaining the similar pair in the Van Eyck chandelier. The eyes turn it into a huge head (with a T on top). This head could be the head of the threefold Tentator, composed of the three 'persons' but who are also equal to the whole. If the devil's face adds the (seeing) right eye to the Tentator head, then the Antichrist may add the (unseeing) left eye. Unlike Satan/the devil he doesn't appear to have a head of his own of which this blind eye is a part. Instead, the eye appears to add a scrotum to a phallic candle.                  

{% include image.html

            caption="The scrotal eye" %}    

The greyish wax is cut off from view in such a way that it looks like the light head of a brass penis. The association of the blind eye with a phallic form could mean that the blindness is the blindness of the mind when a being is dominated by the body, and busy satisfying its needs. This excessive physicality can be called anti-Christian, because the Word should be primary, not the flesh. 

The blind eye is can also be seen as the reflection of the simple fact that this right side of the chandelier is significantly darker than the left side, which obviously profits more from the light outside. (Although, seen from the Tentator point of view this may not be regarded as 'profit'.) As the darkest side of the chandelier, the right side can be considered most antithetic to the Light of the World and therefore the most anti-Christian. So this side is most likely dominated by Tentator Antichrist. Except for the fact that his name isn't 'Antichrist', I can't think of any reason why Satan/the devil is more 'enlightened' than the Antichrist. It is mainly the devilish head in the left side and the batlike head in the center that makes me think that Satan/the devil is dominant in the left side of the chandelier and that Lucifer dominates the center.

Being a trinity, the three *personae* are also one (sunstance). Meaning, I think, that the head of Tentator, the big chandelier head, represents the face of all three components. A face with one working eye (thanks to the daylight) and one blind eye. Why the unequal pair, that Meckenem deemed important enough to use in his chandelier? Why was light used to differentiate between the three evil *personae*? Perhaps to show that darkness is seldom complete and evil seldom pure. And perhaps to suggest that the duality between the good mirror and the evil chandelier isn't so absolute. Apart from this, I can think of two other possible reasons for the eye situation. 

First, it could refer to the saying 'In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king'. Erasmus had recorded a Latin version in his *Adagia* (*in regione caecorum rex est luscus*), and perhaps Van Eyck before him was aware of it. Perhaps he even knew the much older version from the Genesis Rabbah: "In the street of the blind, the one-eyed man is called the Guiding Light". King or Guiding Light, both fit the chandelier Tentator, the bringer of weak and/or false light. It fits Lucifer the Morning Star, whose light pales in comparison to the light of the sun. 

Second, the Dajjal, the Islamic equivalent of the Antichrist has one blind eye and one seeing eye. Bukhari, via Malik ibn Anas, tells us: "The Prophet Mohammed said, 'No prophet was sent, but that he warned His followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord [Allah] is not so. And there will be written between his eyes the word *kafir*."[^1] In other hadiths the blind eye, usually the right one, is said to be like a protruding grape. In the chandelier it's the apple of the seeing (right) eye that looks more like a grape. Especially because the shape of the head around it is not unlike that of a bunch of grapes. 

Although it's not very likely that Van Eyck read Islamic texts in his spare time, with the expanding Ottoman Empire knocking on the door of Belgrade at the time he may have heard something about the Islamic Antichrist. Perhaps even from Arnolfini himself. On the other had, if he wasn't aware of Dajjal, or of the saying, he may simply have had the idea that seems to be the basis for the Dajjal's ocular condition: to contrast him with Allah the All-Seeing. 

I certainly can't see *kafir* or just *k.f.r.* written between Tentator's eyes. The two openings in the body are plus signs rather than letters. Plusses with horizontal bars that have dropped a little from the middle, making them seem like two Latin crosses turned upside down, like the Cross of Saint Peter, who supposedly was crucified upside down. Being symbols of the first pope, the two openings can be considered a reference to the Church. An *extra* reference, since they are part of the papal tiara-like form in the chandelier, and this is underneath the spire and the battlement of the temple. The two visible embrasures in that battlement are shaped like a trifolium, a symbol of the Holy Trinity. It is telling that these four Christian symbols are just small, empty spaces within a mass of brass.

Battlements are usually associated with the walls of castles. The 'holy' symbols in the embrasures suggest that the Church has become a Castle. Meaning, that the pope has become more like a secular leader, getting the Papal States involved in wars, just like a regular king and his kingdom. The two Petrine Crosses beneath the battlement confirm this degeneration of the Church into a military power, because they also look like eye-slits in a brass helmet. A helmet that largely coincides with the papal tiara in the chandelier, and with that temple tower on top of it, it's fit for a church knight. 

Like the extended tiara, the papal helmet may point to a future situation rather than depict Van Eyck's present. The idea being, again, that the Church is on its way to become identical with the Tentator. In other words, the body of Christ is transforming into the body of Satan. (Or the Antichrist, or Lucifer.) And with warrior popes like Julius II the worst was indeed to come...    

(*Kafir*, by the way, means 'infidel'. This was also the term used for the crusading Franks. Those knights wore helmets not unlike the helmet in the chandelier. So in a sense there may be *kafir* 'written' between the anti-Chtistian eyes after all.)

Slowly but certainly the meaning of the Arnolfini chandelier has become clear. A few more details need to be addressed before its relationship to the mirror will be examined. One of these is still rather puzzling to me. When you zoom into the supposed goatee of the supposed devil in the chandelier, you see this cute little creature:

It may take a while before you see it. It helps to know that the white arrow point at its somewhat triangular right eye. Its left eye is on the same height, in the center of a head that seems to be suppressed by an arch in the chandelier arm above it. The arch clearly pushes down the creature's left ear. A hint of a nose can be seen below the right eye. My impression is that of a wingless baby bat. While the arch gives its head form, its lower end appears to be disintegrating. Without the pressure of an arch it seems formless. Very strange... 

At the moment I can only explain this life form in light of the chandelier as part Church or the future Church. If the head of the Church is becoming more and more like Lucifer (et al), then the battish creature below the arch, low in the chandelier, may represent the lower clergy. Formed by the Church, and in its clutch, but relatively innocent and relatively far removed from the *tentatorial* Roman Curia. The lack of (bat) wings can stress both its innocence and its dependence on the 'Mother church'. Without the grip of the arch it might fall down... onto the mirror. The Passion 'ray' in which Jesus takes up the cross, to be precise. That possible fall would be like, but also very *unlike* Lucifer's fall from heaven. And what's perhaps even stranger than the creature itself is that the potential fall's trajectory can already be seen. (Passing the orange arrows.)

It looks like a long, unintended 'fault line', but I haven't seen a similar crack in the painting, and when you look closely there's a clear difference with the craquelure around it. For one thing, the line is dotted with 'patches' like the one pounted at by the pink arrow. For another, it's cut in three practically equal parts by the swirls of Van Eyck's inscription. The middle part, between the calligraphy, looks thinner and more crack-like than the parts that comnect to the mirror and the chandelier. (The upper half of the upper segment even takes on the colouring of the baby bat.) This thinning suggests that chandelier/mirror connection is hindered by the inscription. Meaning, perhaps, by Van Eyck himself.

Why would he do that?! Is it a good thing or a bad thing? Is this what the inscription is about? (*Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434* – "Jan van Eyck was here 1434".) Does that *hic* refer to the place between the chandelier and the mirror, and in particular to the place between the cross-bearing Jesus and the dangling baby bat (lower clergy)? Is is some sort of confession? "I was here, messing with this line." I call it a 'lifeline' in the caption to the above images of it, because it's the only connection between the chandelier and the mirror. If you consider the chandelier as a symbol of a Church that has become Luciferian, a corrupt Body of Christ, then the opposing mirror could represent the Spirit or Soul of Christ. In that view, that 'lifeline' indicates how far removed the Church is from true Christianity: it's hanging on to it by a thread. And even that thread is threatened. By a 'fork' with Jan van Eyck's name on it. And perhaps also an image of the artist as a fish...                         

{% include image.html

            caption="Fishy J" %}

After tilting the image 90 degrees to the right, it becomes clear that the signature is shaped like a two-pronged (pitch)fork. Its business end consists of a calligraphic part that looks like some sort of musical notation, and a larger part (the J) that looks like a fish. The little red arrow points to its right eye. Below it is a V-shaped mouth that seems interested in have a bit of that 'notation'. So apparently it is J.'s hunger that forms the fork that threatens the thread. 

In those days the fork still had a bad name. The three-pronged model in particular. It was associated with the devil, and demons used them for their prodding. God gave you fingers to eat with, so using a fork instead of those God-given fingers is an insult to His creative work. That was the idea, I think. And so the image of the fork adds weight to the suspicion that *Johannes de eyck* being there was not a good thing. Was he their, being demonic, in 1434, and in a different place when he painted *The Arnolfini Portrait*? That could mean that he painted it after 1434. Unless, of course, he repented in the same year. 

What did he do wrong? What did he do that weakened the tie between the Church and its origin? If you indeed consider the chandelier to be the body of Christ and the mirror His soul/spirit/ghost/whatever, then the fork attack, by aiming to divide the two, can be called an assassination attempt. Feeling guilty of a crime against Christ, Van Eyck may have felt compelled to confess it in a painting. But why in this particular painting? Because it is about marriage? Did the painted joining of a man and a woman give him a good reason to add a painted confession of his attempt to *divorce* (simply put) Jesus Christ and the Church? 

This is what He said (to the Pharisees) about divorce: 
>Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, <br />And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? <br />Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. <span style="float: right; font-size: smaller;">(Matt. 19:4-6)</span>

While the Arnolfini's are 'cleaving' to each other by their hands, above them the painter of their portrait is 'cleaving' the Christian lifeline.
